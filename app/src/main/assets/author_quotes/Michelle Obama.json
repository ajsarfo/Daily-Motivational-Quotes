For me, exercise is more than just physical â€“ it's therapeutic.
How hard you work matters more than how much you make.
America is just downright mean.
We need to do a better job of putting ourselves higher on our own â€˜to do' list.
Every scar that you have is a reminder not just that you got hurt, but that you survived.
Not everybody is going to run a marathon or do a triathlon. It's not necessary to do that to be in good health.
So we know that it's not enough for us to simply encourage more people to study abroad. We also need to make sure that they can actually afford it.
The benefits of studying abroad are almost endless.
Whether an illness affects your heart, your leg or your brain, it's still an illness, and there should be no distinction.
Choose people who lift you up.
We have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be.
No matter who you are, no matter where you come from, you are beautiful.
History has shown us that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own.
You may not always have a comfortable life and you will not always be able to solve all of the world's problems at once but don't ever underestimate the importance you can have because history has shown us that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own.
Do not bring people in your life who weigh you down. And trust your instincts. Good relationships feel good. They feel right. They don’t hurt. They’re not painful. That’s not just with somebody you want to marry, but it’s with the friends that you choose. It’s with the people you surround yourselves with.
You can't make decisions based on fear and the possibility of what might happen.
Service is a limitless opportunity, it is the reason why we breathe.
Do not bring people in your life who weigh you down. And trust your instincts ... good relationships feel good. They feel right. They don't hurt. They're not painful. That's not just with somebody you want to marry, but it's with the friends that you choose. It's with the people you surround yourselves with.
No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half of its citizens.
If my future were determined just by my performance on a standardized test, I wouldn't be here. I guarantee you that.
Be passionate about something and lean to that strength.
The problem is when that fun stuff becomes the habit. And I think that's what's happened in our culture. Fast food has become the everyday meal.
We learned about honesty and integrity - that the truth matters... that you don't take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules... and success doesn't count unless you earn it fair and square.
Don't judge. I used to buy underwear because I didn't do my laundry.
The work-life balance is a harsh reality for so many women, who are forced every day to make impossible choices. Do they take their kids to the doctor ... and risk getting fired? Do they work weekends so they can afford to send their kids to better childcare ... even though it means even less time with their families? Do they take another shift at work, so they can pay for piano lessons for their kids ... even though it means they have to stop volunteering for the PTA? It just shouldn't be this difficult to raise healthy families.
We explain when someone is cruel or acts like a bully, you do not stoop to their level. Our motto is when they go low, you go high.
The fact is, with every friendship you make, and every bond of trust you establish, you are shaping the image of America projected to the rest of the world. That is so important. So when you study abroad, you're actually helping to make America stronger.
Exercise is really important to me - it's therapeutic. So if I'm ever feeling tense or stressed or like I'm about to have a meltdown, I'll put on my iPod and head to the gym or out on a bike ride along Lake Michigan with the girls.
Success isn't about how much money you make; it's about the difference you make in people's lives.
The game of politics is to make you afraid so that you don't think.
Strong men, men who are truly role models, don't need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful
Grief and resilience live together.
I never cut class. I loved getting A's, I liked being smart. I liked being on time. I thought being smart is cooler than anything in the world.
You all have opportunities, skills, and education that so many folks who came before you never could have dreamed of. So just imagine the kind of impact that you're going to make. Imagine how you can inspire those around you to reach higher and complete their own education.
Just try new things. Don't be afraid.

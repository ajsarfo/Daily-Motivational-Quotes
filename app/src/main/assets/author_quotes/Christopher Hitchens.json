The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks.
Nonintervention does not mean that nothing happens. It means that something else happens.
The essence of tyranny is not iron law. It is capricious law.
Unless a reincarnationist is willing to say there was a 'first generation' of souls created with the first humans, he is exposed to absurdity by the recency of human life on the planet.
Teasing is very often a sign of inner misery.
If you can charm everyone it means you don't care about anyone in particular.
The true essence of a dictatorship is in fact not its regularity but its unpredictability and caprice; those who live under it must never be able to relax, must never be quite sure if they have followed the rules correctly or not.
Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it.
The usual duty of the â€œintellectualâ€ is to argue for complexity and to insist that phenomena in the world of ideas should not be sloganized or reduced to easily repeated formulae.
What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.
Human beings are pattern-seeking animals who will prefer even a bad theory or a conspiracy theory to no theory at all.
Morality comes from humanism and is stolen by religion for its own purposes.
To 'choose' dogma and faith over doubt and experience is to throw out the ripening vintage and to reach greedily for the Kool-Aid.
Dogma in power does have a unique chilling ingredient not exhibited by power, however ghastly, wielded for its own traditional sake.
Instead, the polling business gives the patricians an idea of what the mob is thinking, and of how that thinking might be changed or, shall we say, 'shaped.' It is the essential weapon in the mastery of populism by the elite.

Charity... is a form of condescension.
What I do mind is the pitying glance, or the heavy sigh, that is deployed these days. I am not ready to be patronized, or condescended to, unless by someone of some eminence who has earned that right. And even then I regard it as a sign of weakness rather than strength.
The struggle for a free intelligence has always been a struggle between the ironic and the literal mind.
The one thing that the racist can never manage is anything like discrimination: he is indiscriminate by definition.

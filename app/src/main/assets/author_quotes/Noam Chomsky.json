I like the cold weather. It means you get work done.
If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all.
Tough love is just the right phrase: love for the rich and privileged, tough for everyone else.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
You never need an argument against the use of violence, you need an argument for it.
Organization and education, when they interact with each other, they strengthen each other, they are mutually supportive.
The internet could be a very positive step towards education, organisation and participation in a meaningful society.
As a research tool, the internet is invaluable.
Like most technology, the internet has mixed effects. It's a neutral instrument.
The internet is an Ã©lite organization; most of the population of the world has never even made a phone call.
A basic principle of modern state capitalism is that costs and risks are socialized to the extent possible, while profit is privatized.
Everybody's worried about stopping terrorism. Well, there's a really easy way: stop participating in it.
Citizenship means every four years you put a mark somewhere and you go home and let other guys run the world. It's a very destructive ideology.
Libertarian socialism is properly to be regarded as the inheritor of the liberal ideals of the enlightenment.
Propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state.
It's perfectly obvious that there is some genetic factor that distinguishes humans from other animals and that it is language-specific. The theory of that genetic component, whatever it turns out to be, is what is called universal grammar.
Descriptive grammar is an attempt to give an account of what the current system is for either a society or an individual, whatever you happen to be studying.
Historical grammar is a study of how, say, modern English developed from Middle English, and how that developed from Early and Old English, and how that developed from Germanic, and that developed from what's called Proto-Indo-European, a source system that nobody speaks, so you have to try to reconstruct it.
The probability of apocalypse soon cannot be realistically estimated, but it is surely too high for any sane person to contemplate with equanimity.
Discovery is the ability to be puzzled by simple things.
It's dangerous when people are willing to give up their privacy.
Nationalism has a way of oppressing others.
Debt is a social and ideological construct, not a simple economic fact.
There are all the activist groups on every imaginable topic - solidarity groups, environmental and feminist groups - sectors of these movements do very valuable work.
Concentration of wealth yields concentration of political power. And concentration of political power gives rise to legislation that increases and accelerates the cycle.
If we choose, we can live in a world of comforting illusion.
The worst drug of all by far is tobacco; the death toll from tobacco is just overwhelming.
In the moral calculus of currently prevailing state capitalism, profits and bonuses in the next quarter greatly outweigh concern for the welfare of one's grandchildren, and since these are institutional maladies, they will not be easy to overcome. While much remains uncertain, we can assure ourselves, with fair confidence, that future generations will not forgive us our silence and apathy.
Cuba has become a symbol of courageous resistance to attack. Since 1959, Cuba has been under attack from the hemispheric superpower.
You cannot control your own population by force, but it can be distracted by consumption.
The general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know.
It is reported that about 30% of the world's population is unemployed. That's worse than the Great Depression, but it's now an international phenomenon.
The best defense against democracy is to distract people.
The first commitment is raise your salary. One of the ways to raise your salary sometimes is to have short-term profits but there are many other ways.
The more privilege you have, the more opportunity you have. The more opportunity you have, the more responsibility you have.
Resistance is feasible even for those who are not heroes by nature, and it is an obligation, I believe, for those who fear the consequences and detest the reality of the attempt to impose American hegemony.
The reason academic disputes are so vicious is that so little is at stake.
In the academic world, most of the work that is done is clerical. A lot of the work done by professors is routine.
There is a social responsibility to take care of vulnerable people. It seems that a sensible social responsibility is obligatory education, but also decent education, and that is not happening.
You keep plugging away--that's the way social change takes place. That's the way every social change in history has taken place: by a lot of people, who nobody ever heard of, doing work.
There is massive propaganda for everyone to consume. Consumption is good for profits and consumption is good for the political establishment.
The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor led to many very good things. If you follow the trail, it led to kicking Europeans out of Asia - that saved tens of millions of lives in India alone.
Silicon Valley wouldn't exist without massive government spending and in fact initiative.
If something is repeated over and over as obvious, the chances are that it is obviously false.
Either you repeat the same conventional doctrines everybody is saying, or else you say something true, and it will sound like it's from Neptune.
Industrial production of meat makes a huge contribution to global warming.
There's plenty to criticize about the mass media, but they are the source of regular information about a wide range of topics. You can't duplicate that on blogs.
The mass media serve as a system for communicating messages and symbols to the general populace. It is their function to amuse, entertain, and inform, and to inculcate individuals with the values, beliefs, and codes of behavior that will integrate them into the institutional structures of the larger society. In a world of concentrated wealth and major conflicts of class interest, to fulfil this role requires systematic propaganda.
You are responsible for the predictable consequences of your actions.
Democracy, in any rational form, also imposes conditions on majority rule. That's what the Bill of Rights is about, for example.
It is quite possible--overwhelmingly probable, one might guess--that we will always learn more about human life and personality from novels than from scientific psychology.
The 1950s and 1960s had been a period of enormous growth, the highest in American history, maybe in economic history.
Some of the most moving experiences I've had are just in black churches in the South, during the Civil Rights Movement, where people were getting beaten, killed, really struggling for the most elementary rights.
Sea level rise and destruction of water resources as glaciers melt alone may have horrendous human consequences.
If you take an economics or a political science course, you're taught that humans are supposed to be rational wealth accumulators, each acting as an individual to maximize his own wealth in the market.
The Internet is an élite organization; most of the population of the world has never even made a phone call.
See, people with power understand exactly one thing: violence.
The principle that human nature, in its psychological aspects, is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful.
As soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action arise, human science is at a loss.
Democracy and freedom are more than just ideals, to be valued that may be essential for survival.
Corporations barely pay taxes. The corporate tax rate is already very low, but corporations have worked out an array of complicated techniques so they often don't have to pay taxes at all... The scale of sheer robbery by corporate power is enormous.
If we do not believe in freedom of speech for those we despise, we do not believe in it at all.
Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so.
The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.

We can change our lives. We can do, have, and be exactly what we wish.
To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.
The strongest force in the universe is a human being living consistently with his identity.
Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more.
Most people have no idea of the giant capacity we can immediately command when we focus all of our resources on mastering a single area of our lives.
All successful people learn that success is buried on the other side of frustration.
The meeting of preparation with opportunity generates the offspring we call luck.
No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you're still way ahead of everyone who isn't trying.
If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten.
Every problem is a gift-without problems we would not grow.
By changing nothing, nothing changes.
The quality of your life is in direct proportion to the amount of uncertainty you can comfortably deal with.
I've come to believe that all my past failure and frustration were actually laying the foundation for the understandings that have created the new level of living I now enjoy.
Everybody's got a past. The past does not equal the future unless you live there.
Excitement must lead to immediate action or you will lose the power of momentum. More dreams die because we fail to seize the moment.
All goal setting must be immediately followed by both the development of a plan, and massive and consistent action toward its fulfillment.
Using the power of decision gives you the capacity to get past any excuse to change any and every part of your life in an instant.
Whatever happens, take responsibility.
In essence, if we want to direct our lives, we must take control of our consistent actions. It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives, but what we do consistently.
People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn't trying.
People are not lazy. They simply have impotent goals â€“ that is, goals that do not inspire them.
One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular.
I've come to believe that all my past failure and frustrations were actually laying the foundation for the understandings that have created the new level of living I now enjoy.
Everything happens for a reason and a purpose, and it serves you.
My definition of success is to live your life in a way that causes you to feel a ton of pleasure and very little pain - and because of your lifestyle, have the people around you feel a lot more pleasure than they do pain.
Self awareness is one of the rarest of human commodities. I don't mean self consciousn ess where you're limiting and evaluating yourself. I mean being aware of your own patterns.
The path to success is to take massive, determined action.
Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment.
Successful people ask better questions, and as a result, they get better answers.
People are not lazy. They simply have impotent goals - that is, goals that do not inspire them.
You can't influence somebody when you're judging them.
Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.
Identity is this incredible invisible force that controls your whole life. It's invisible, like gravity is invisible, but it controls your whole life.
In life you need either inspiration or desperation.
If you're gonna make a change, you're gonna have to operate from a new belief that says life happens not to me but for me.
Change is inevitable. Progress is optional.
The only way a relationship will last is if you see it as a place that you go to give, and not a place that you go to take.
Working because you want to, not because you have to is financial freedom.
Resolutions require only words. Results take action.
There's always a way - if you're committed.
The most important thing is what you already do. It's being authentic. It's being curious, trying to discover gifts.
Plan for pleasure for each and every day.
If you want to change your life you have to raise your standards.
If you don't set a baseline standard for what you'll accept in life, you'll find it's easy to slip into behaviors and attitudes or a quality of life that's far below what you deserve.
Success without fulfillment is failure.
It's not the events of our lives that shape us, but our beliefs as to what those events mean.
The most important thing you can do to achieve your goals is to make sure that as soon as you set them you immediately begin to create momentum.
The only limit to your impact is your imagination and commitment.
Problems are spiritual lessons from God-spiritual lessons to be learned.
You can't hit a target if you don't know what it is.
A life of fulfillment is one in which we put urgency in its place and remember that the ultimate target is to spend our lives doing the things we believe are most important to us.
Just because someone seems to have more certainty, doesn't mean they're right.
Your current situation is no indication of your ultimate potential
The questions you ask consistently will create either enervation or enjoyment, indignation or inspiration, misery or magic. Ask the questions that will uplift your spirit and push you along the path of human excellence.
Complexity is the enemy of execution.
If complexity doesn't beat you, paradox will.

The road to someday leads to a town of nowhere.
There is no breakthrough without a breakdown.
All personal breakthroughs being with a change in beliefs. So how do we change? The most effective way is to get your brain to associate massive pain to the old belief.
Remember: Rewards come in action, not in discussion.
It's not knowing what to do, it's doing what you know.
There is no such thing as failure. There are only results.
Whenever people have trouble public speaking, it's because they are just thinking about themselves.
If you want to grow a muscle, you must lift something out of your comfort zone. Push beyond what is comfortable. If you don't there will be no growth.
Your number one skill as a leader is the ability to influence.
The path of least resistance will never make you proud.
Most of us make unconscious choices in the words that we use; we sleep-walk through the maze of possibilities available to us.
Achievers rarely, if ever, see a problem as permanent, while those who fail see even the smallest problems as permanent.
Why not make cheerfulness, outrageousness, playfulness a new priority for yourself? Make feeling good your expectation.
Complexity is the enemy of execution.
Knowing information is not the same as owning it and following through. Information without execution is poverty. Remember: we’re drowning in information, but we’re starving for wisdom.
Ten years from now you'll laugh at whatever's stressing you out today.
Your biography is not your destiny, your decisions are.
The secret of success is learning how to use pain and pleasure instead of having pain and pleasure use you. If you do that, you're in control of your life. If you don't, life controls you.
No one’s life is a smooth sail; we all come into stormy weather. But it’s this adversity – and more specifically our resilience – that makes us strong and successful.
The truth is that we can learn to condition our minds, bodies, and emotions to link pain or pleasure to whatever we choose. By changing what we link pain and pleasure to, we will instantly change our behaviors.
Human beings absolutely follow through on who they believe they are.
The greatest leverage you can create for yourself is the pain that comes from inside, not outside. Knowing that you have failed to live up to your own standards for your life is the ultimate pain.
The human body is the best picture of the human soul.
Identify your problems, but give your power and energy to solutions.
Once you have mastered time, you will understand how true it is that most people overestimate what they can accomplish in a year – and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade.
No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow your progress, you’re still way ahead of everyone who isn’t trying.
“The way we communicate with others and with ourselves ultimately determines the quality of our lives.
Problems are the gifts that make us dig out and figure out who we are, what we’re made for, and what we’re responsible to give back to life.
If you've got a billion dollars and you're ungrateful, you're a poor man. If you have very little but you're grateful for what you have, you're truly rich.
The road to success is always under construction. It is a progressive course, not an end to be reached.
Live life fully while you're here. Experience everything. Take care of yourself and your friends. Have fun, be crazy, be weird. Go out and screw up! You're going to anyway, so you might as well enjoy the process. Take the opportunity to learn from your mistakes: find the cause of your problem and eliminate it. Don't try to be perfect; just be an excellent example of being human.

Energy is a bit like money: if you have a positive balance, you can distribute it in various ways, but according to the classical laws that were believed at the beginning of the century, you weren't allowed to be overdrawn.
Quiet people have the loudest minds.
Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it
My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn't prevent you doing well, and don't regret the things it interferes with. Don't be disabled in spirit as well as physically.
It is a waste of time to be angry about my disability. One has to get on with life and I haven't done badly. People won't have time for you if you are always angry or complaining.
We are all now connected by the internet, like neurons in a giant brain.
The people who actually make the advances in theoretical physics don't think in these categories that the philosophers and the historians of science subsequently invent for them.
Time and space are finite in extent, but they don't have any boundary or edge. They would be like the surface of the earth, but with two more dimensions.
Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.
Teamwork means never having to take all the blame yourself.
Time travel used to be thought of as just science fiction, but Einstein's general theory of relativity allows for the possibility that we could warp space-time so much that you could go off in a rocket and return before you set out.
Even if it turns out that time travel is impossible, it is important that we understand why it is impossible.
When one's expectations are reduced to zero, one really appreciates everything one does have.
Never put off the work till tomorrow what you can put off today.
The more you learn, the more you know. The more you know, the more you forget. The more you forget, the less you know. So why bother to learn.
The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.
A zero-gravity flight is a first step toward space travel.
The human race may be the only intelligent beings in the galaxy.
The increase of disorder or entropy with time is one example of what is called an arrow of time, something that distinguishes the past from the future, giving a direction to time.
Being confined to a wheelchair doesn't bother me as my mind is free to roam the universe, but it felt wonderful to be weightless.
People won't have time for you if you are always angry or complaining.
In the last 200 years the population of our planet has grown exponentially, at a rate of 1.9% per year. If it continued at this rate, with the population doubling every 40 years, by 2600 we would all be standing literally shoulder to shoulder.
The thing about smart people is that they seem like crazy people to dumb people.
If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.... We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet.
I am discounting reports of UFOs.
We are only the temporary custodians of the particles which we are made of.
Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing.
It's the gravity that shapes the large scale structure of the universe, even though it is the weakest of four categories of forces
If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans.
I believe alien life is quite common in the universe, although intelligent life is less so. Some say it has yet to appear on planet Earth.
Considering the number of planets and stars that we know exist, it's extremely unlikely that we are the only form of evolved life
We should seek the greatest value of our action.
Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.
Quantum physics tells us that no matter how thorough our observation of the present, the (unobserved) past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.
In less than a hundred years, we have found a new way to think of ourselves. From sitting at the center of the universe, we now find ourselves orbiting an average-sized sun, which is just one of millions of stars in our own Milky Way galaxy.
Not only does God play dice, but... he sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen.
The fastest manned vehicle in history was Apollo 10. It reached 25,000 mph.
In my opinion, there is no aspect of reality beyond the reach of the human mind.
Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.
A few years ago, the city council of Monza, Italy, barred pet owners from keeping goldfish in curved bowls... saying that it is cruel to keep a fish in a bowl with curved sides because, gazing out, the fish would have a distorted view of reality.
Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially, along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill.
I would like nuclear fusion to become a practical power source. It would provide an inexhaustible supply of energy, without pollution or global warming.
Success is a relative term. It brings so many relatives.
However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.
It is a waste of time to be angry about my disability. One has to get on with life and I haven't done badly. People won’t have time for you if you are always angry or complaining.
To my mathematical brain, the numbers of planets in the universe make thinking about aliens perfectly rational.
Space creatures might not be visiting Earth with peaceful intentions.
If the government is covering up knowledge of aliens, they are doing a better job of it than they do at anything else.
We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.
I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road.
Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.
By 2600, the world population would be standing shoulder to shoulder and the electricity consumed would make the earth glow red-hot.
However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. Where there's life, there's hope.
Without imperfection, you or I would not exist.
Equations are just the boring part of mathematics. I attempt to see things in terms of geometry.
Do you ever wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges?
Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious, and however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up.
One can see from space how the human race has changed the Earth. Nearly all of the available land has been cleared of forest and is now used for agriculture or urban development. The polar ice caps are shrinking and the desert areas are increasing. At night, the Earth is no longer dark, but large areas are lit up. All of this is evidence that human exploitation of the planet is reaching a critical limit. But human demands and expectations are ever-increasing. We cannot continue to pollute the atmosphere, poison the ocean and exhaust the land. There isn't any more available.
One of the most serious consequences of our actions is global warming brought about by rising levels of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. The danger is that the temperature increase might become self-sustaining if it has not done so already.
One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there, and don’t throw it away.

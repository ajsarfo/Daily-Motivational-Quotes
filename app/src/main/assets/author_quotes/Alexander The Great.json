There is nothing impossible to him who will try.
I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.
I am indebted to my father for living, but to my teacher for living well.
Upon the conduct of each depends the fate of all.
A tomb now suffices him for whom the whole world was not sufficient.
I would rather live a short life of glory than a long one of obscurity.
It is a lovely thing to live with courage and die leaving an everlasting renown.
Every light is not the sun.
Remember upon the conduct of each depends the fate of all.
I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep, I am afraud of an army of sheep led by a lion.
I am not afraid of an army of lions lead by a sheep; I am afraid of sheep lead by a lion.

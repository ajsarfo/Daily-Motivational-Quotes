Being an entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death.
Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.
Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics. It's really counterintuitive.
When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.
Some people don't like change, but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster.

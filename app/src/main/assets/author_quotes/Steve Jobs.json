Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.
No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.
Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.
Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity - not a threat.
Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently -- they're not fond of rules... they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinion drown your own inner voice. Everything else is secondary.

Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.
If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you've done and whoever you were and throw them away.

It's more fun to be a pirate than to join the navy.
Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
I'm as proud of many of the things we haven't done as the things we have done. Innovation is saying no to a thousand things.
Focusing is about saying No.

Management is about persuading people to do things they do not want to do, while leadership is about inspiring people to do things they never thought they could.
Stay hungry. Stay foolish. Never let go of your appetite to go after new ideas, new experiences, and new adventures.
We have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.
There is always one more thing to learn.
If you define the problem correctly, you almost have the solution.
It's not about money. It's about the people you have, and how you're led.

The most corrosive piece of technology that I've ever seen is called television â€“ but then again, television, at its best, is magnificent.
When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You'll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back.
What a computer is to me is the most remarkable tool that we have ever come up with. It's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.
The desktop metaphor was invented because one, you were a stand-alone device, and two, you had to manage your own storage. That's a very big thing in a desktop world. And that may go away. You may not have to manage your own storage. You may not store much before too long.
The desktop computer industry is dead. Innovation has virtually ceased. Microsoft dominates with very little innovation. That's over. Apple lost. The desktop market has entered the dark ages, and it's going to be in the dark ages for the next 10 years, or certainly for the rest of this decade.
It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do. We hire smart people and they tell us what to do.

Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.
When you're in a startup, the first ten people will determine whether the company succeeds or not.
We don’t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life.
Older people sit down and ask, 'what is it', but the boy asks, What can I do with it?
You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they'll want something new.
To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.
I'm not dismissing the value of higher education; I'm simply saying it comes at the expense of experience.
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.
Whenever you do any one thing intensely over a period of time you have to give up other lives you could be living. You have to have a real single-minded kind of tunnel vision if you want to get anything significant accomplished. Especially if the desire is not to be a businessman, but to be a creative person.
When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something.
Great things in business are never done by one person; they’re done by a team of people.

I have a great respect for incremental improvement, and I’ve done that sort of thing in my life, but I’ve always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don’t know why. Because they’re harder. They’re much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you’ve completely failed.

I'm convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.
Technology is nothing. What’s important is that you have a faith in people, that they’re basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they’ll do wonderful things with them.
That's been one of my mantras focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex. You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.
Details matter. It’s worth waiting to get it right.
Your life will never make sense until you look in the rear view mirror.
If you are working on something exciting that you really care about, you don't have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.
The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.

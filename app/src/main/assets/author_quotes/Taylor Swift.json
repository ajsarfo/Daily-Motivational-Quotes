If they don't like you for being yourself, be yourself even more.
When you are missing someone, time seems to move slower, and when I'm falling in love with someone, time seems to be moving faster.
They're [haters] just building you up to knock you down. But for me, they haven't.
In a relationship each person should support the other; they should lift each other up.
The drama and the trauma of the relationship you have when you're 16 can mirror the one you have when you're 26. Life repeats itself.
Unique and different is the next generation of beautiful.
I miss you more than the sun misses the sky at night.
I haven't had that one great love, which is good. I don't want that to be in the past - I want it to be in the future.
Live your life like you are 80 years old looking back on your teenage years.
This is a new year. A new beginning. And things will change.
Be that strong girl that everyone knew would make it through the worst, be that fearless girl, the one who would dare to do anything, be that independent girl who didn't need a man; be that girl who never backed down.
It's possible to climb to the top without stomping on other people.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.
Being fearless isn't being 100% Not fearful, it's being terrified but you jump anyway.
Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again....even though every time you've tried before you've lost.
I'd rather be at home and eat ice cream than go out and get wasted.
I think that personality traits that come through when somebody is really sincere is what makes them beautiful.
I'm a Sagittarius, and one of our major qualities is that we're blindly optimistic.
We all dream about love, want to be in love, and have been hurt by love.
Red is such an interesting color to correlate with emotion, because it's on both ends of the spectrum. On one end you have happiness, falling in love, infatuation with someone, passion, all that. On the other end, you've got obsession, jealousy, danger, fear, anger and frustration.
When you're young you just run, but you come back to what you need.
The trials and tribulations in your life make you stronger.
The look on someone's face when they're doing what they love is contagious and inspiring.
I still like to live in a whimsical world that seems more romantic and fantasy-related because real life seems so hard.
People haven't always been there for me, but music always has.
If you have something about yourself that's different, you're lucky. It's not a curse.
Being fearless doesn't mean you have no fears. it means you're strong enough to face them.
Never forget the essence of your spark!
There's glitter on the floor after the party.
No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind.
No amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity.
I'm the girl who still believes prince charming exists somewhere out there.
Love always ends differently and it always begins differently - especially with me
When you're singing you can hear the echo of people in the audience singing every single word with you, and that was that big dream that I had for myself. It's happening.
I've always felt music is the only way to give an instantaneous moment the feel of slow motion. To romanticise it and glorify it and give it a soundtrack and a rhythm.
When I figured out how to work my grill, it was quite a moment. I discovered that summer is a completely different experience when you know how to grill.
Maybe this is wishful thinking, Probably mindless dreaming but if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right,
If you're trying too hard to be the girl next door, you're not going to be.
Relationships are like traffic lights. And I just have this theory that I can only exist in a relationship if it's a green light.
If they don’t like you for being yourself, be yourself even more.
This isn't a high school thing or an age thing. It's a people thing. People cut other people down out of jealousy, because of something broken inside them, or for no reason at all. Just don't let them change you or stop you from singing or dancing around to your favorite song.
You, with your words like knives . And swords and weapons that you use against me . You, have knocked me off my feet again, . Got me feeling like a nothing . You, with your voice like nails . On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded .
For a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated, a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way. That's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist.
You're an expert at sorry and keeping the lines blurry.
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town.
When you're 25 or 30, you know, you can't wear lime-green eye shadow anymore. When you're 25 or 30, you know, you can't wear lime-green eye shadow anymore.
Misogyny is ingrained in people from the time they are born. So to me, feminism is probably the most important movement that you could embrace, because it's just basically another word for equality.
Oh, a simple complication . Miscommunications lead to fall out . So many things that I wish you knew .
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile In the back of my mind making me feel like I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
If somebody hurts you, it's okay to cry a river, just remember to build a bridge and get over it.
It’s possible to climb to the top without stomping on other people.
I think every girl's dream is to find a bad boy at the right time, when he wants to not be bad anymore.
When I go to a restaurant, yeah, I know that a line is probably going to form in front of the table, but didn't I always wish for that? Yeah, I did.
Silence speaks so much louder than screaming tantrums. Never give anyone an excuse to say that you're crazy.
My definition of country music is really pretty simple. It's when someone sings about their life and what they know, from an authentic place.
I think the first thing you should know is that nobody in country music 'made it' the same way. It's all different. There's no blueprint for success, and sometimes you just have to work at it.
Cause when you're fifteen, . Somebody tells you they love you . You're gonna believe them .
Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear.
Turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
When you are missing someone, time seems to move slower, and when I'm falling in love with someone time seems to be moving faster.
I used to know my place was a spot next to you . Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat .
When you are missing someone, time seems to move slower, and when I’m falling in love with someone, time seems to be moving faster.

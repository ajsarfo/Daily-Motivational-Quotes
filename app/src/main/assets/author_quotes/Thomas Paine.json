Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one.
It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.
The real man smiles in trouble, gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection.
Human nature is not of itself vicious.
It is an affront to treat falsehood with complaisance.
Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it.
The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value.

'Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death.
An army of principles can penetrate where an army of soldiers cannot.

The balance of power is the scale of peace.
He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from opposition; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach himself.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.

The cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf.
There is something in corruption which, like a jaundiced eye, transfers the color of itself to the object it looks upon, and sees everything stained and impure.
It is the direction and not the magnitude which is to be taken into consideration.
He that rebels against reason is a real rebel, but he that in defence of reason rebels against tyranny has a better title to Defender of the Faith, than George the Third.
Of all the tyrannies that affect mankind, tyranny in religion is the worst.
Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.

A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right.
What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value.
Public credit is suspicion asleep.
The deist needs none of those tricks and shows called miracles to confirm his faith, for what can be a greater miracle than the creation itself, and his own existence?
In Deism our reason and our belief become happily united. The wonderful structure of the universe, and everything we behold in the system of the creation, prove to us, far better than books can do, the existence of a God, and at the same time proclaim His attributes.
There is a happiness in Deism, when rightly understood, that is not to be found inany other system of religion.

Titles are but nicknames, and every nickname is a title.
Titles do not count with posterity.
Titles are like a magicians wand which circumscribe human facility and prevent us from living the lives of man.

I remembered all those years, including the day she was ten and announced to the family that when she grew up she was going to be a doctor and help people...Now at twenty, there she was in college enrolled in Davidsonâ€™s premedical major, pursuing her dream.

In marriage, the love language of physical touch includes everything from putting a hand in your mate's shoulder as you walk by, touching his or her leg when you're driving together, and holding hands while you're walking to kissing, embracing and sexual intercourse.

An apology has more impact when it's specific.
Those we care about most are those most affected by our apologies.
Apologizing to oneself requires self-talk.
What most people are looking for in an apology is sincerity.
For an apology to be accepted, you need to speak the language that conveys to the offended your sincerity.
Expressing regret is the emotional aspect of an apology.
Anytime an apology is followed by an excuse for the offense, the excuse cancels out the apology in my mind.
A sincere apology will deepen the relationship rather than destroy it.
The quicker and more thorough the apology, the more likely the apologizer is to receive genuine forgiveness and restoration of the relationships.
A forgiving person stands ready to forgive when an apology is offered.
When no apology is forthcoming, a forgiving person will take the initiative to lovingly confront the person in the wrong and offer forgiveness.

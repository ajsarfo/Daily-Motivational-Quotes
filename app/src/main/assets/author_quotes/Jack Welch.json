We know where most of the creativity, the innovation, the stuff that drives productivity lies - in the minds of those closest to the work.
There's no such thing as work-life balance. There are work-life choices, and you make them, and they have consequences.
I'm not perfect, but if there are any points given for caring about people with every fiber of your being and giving life all you've got every day, then I suppose I have a shot.

There are only three measurements that tell you nearly everything you need to know about your organization's overall performance: employee engagement, customer satisfaction, and cash flow. It goes without saying that no company, small or large, can win over the long run without energized employees who believe in the mission and understand how to achieve it.
Every employee, not just the senior people, should know how a company is doing.
No doubt emotional intelligence is more rare than book smarts, but my experience says it is actually more important in the making of a leader. You just can't ignore it.
Change before you have to.
Globalization is now no longer an objective but an imperative, as markets open and geographic barriers become increasingly blurred and even irrelevant.
Globalization has taken a hit in that there is some sand in the gears because most of us have supply chains that are all over the world that we've had to lengthen.

Number one, cash is king; number two, communicate; number three, buy or bury the competition.
An overburdened, overstretched executive is the best executive, because he or she doesn't have the time to meddle, to deal in trivia, to bother people.
Willingness to change is a strength, even if it means plunging part of the company into total confusion for a while.
We bring together the best ideas, turning the meetings of our top managers into intellectual orgies.

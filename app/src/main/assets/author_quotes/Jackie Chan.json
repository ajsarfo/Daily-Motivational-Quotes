Coffee is a language in itself
Coffee is a language in itself.
We learn martial arts as helping weakness. You never fight for people to get hurt. You're always helping people.
Martial arts is not for hurting people, it's for protecting people.
The kids never listen to you, especially the youngest ones.
Do not let circumstances control you. You change your circumstances.
As one tale ends, so another begins.
I want to build up my philosophy... my philosophy with kung fu is to respect people.
Kung fu lives in everything we do. It lives in how we put on a jacket and how we take off a jacket. It lives in how we treat people. Everything is kung fu.
I allowed myself to be bullied because I was scared and didn't know how to defend myself. I was bullied until I prevented a new student from being bullied. By standing up for him, I learned to stand up for myself.
The ads all call me fearless, but that's just publicity. Anyone who thinks I'm not scared out of my mind whenever I do one of my stunts is crazier than I am.
American stuntmen are smart - they think about safety. When they do a jump in a car, they calculate everything: the speed, the distance... But in Hong Kong, we don't know how to count. Everything we do is a guess. If you've got the guts, you do it. All of my stuntmen have gotten hurt.
Within each of us lies conflicting forces: yin and yang, light and dark, good and evil.
I’m crazy, but I’m not stupid.
Sometimes it takes only one act of kindness and caring to change a person’s life.

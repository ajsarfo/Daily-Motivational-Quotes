Be that self which one truly is.
Don't forget to love yourself.
Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
Boredom is the root of all evil--the despairing refusal to be oneself.

Only one deception is possible in the infinite sense, self-deception.
During the first period of a man's life, the danger is not to take the risk.
I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations - one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it - you will regret both.

The thinker without a paradox is like a lover without a feeling: a paltry mediocrity.
Purity of heart is to will one thing.
The paradox in Christian truth is invariably due to the fact that it is the truth that exists for God. The standard of measure and the end is superhuman; and there is only one relationship possible: faith.
Face the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.
But the life of freedom requires a beginning, and here a beginning is a resolution, and the resolution has its work and its pain-thus the beginning has its difficulty.
Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate.

Dread is a sympathetic antipathy and an antipathetic sympathy.
The dread of sin can sometimes in effect drive a person into sin through dread.
Just as in the great moment of resignation one does not mediate but chooses, now the task is to gain proficiency in repeating the impassioned choice and, existing, to express it in existence.
The Bible is very easy to understand. But we Christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand, we are obliged to act accordingly.
Dread is a sympathetic antipathy and an antipathetic sympathy.
Of all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy -- to be a man who is brisk about his food and his work. Therefore, whenever I see a fly settling, in the decisive moment, on the nose of such a person of affairs; or if he is spattered with mud from a carriage which drives past him in still greater haste; or the drawbridge opens up before him; or a tile falls down and knocks him dead, then I laugh heartily.
The greatest hazard of all, losing one’s self, can occur very quietly in the world, as if it were nothing at all. No other loss can occur so quietly; any other loss - an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife, etc. - is sure to be noticed.

Only the noble of heart are called to difficulty.
There are, as is known, insects that die in the moment of fertilization. So it is with all joy: life's highest, most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death.

No time of life is so beautiful as the early days of love, when with every meeting, every glance, one fetches something new home to rejoice over.
For I have trained myself and am training myself always to be able to dance lightly in the service of thought
What, then, is depression? It is hysteria of the spirit.
There is something unexplainable in depression [Tungsind]. A person with a sorrow or a worry knows why he sorrows or worries. If a depressed person is asked what the reason is, what it is that weighs [tynge] on him, he will answer: I do not know; I cannot explain it. Therein lies the limitlessness of depression.
In addition to my other numerous acquaintances, I have one more intimate confidant... My depression is the most faithful mistress I have known—no wonder, then, that I return the love.
The paradox is the authentic pathos of the intellectual life, and just as only great souls are susceptible to passions, so are only great thinkers susceptible to what I call Sparadoxes, which are nothing other than grandiose thoughts, not yet fully developed.
But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.

Repetition is a beloved wife of whom one never tires because it is only the new of which one tires.
One never tires of the old, and when one has it before oneself one is happy, and only a person who does not delude himself that repetition ought to be something new, for then he tires of it, is genuinely happy.
It requires youthfulness to hope and youthfulness to recollect, but It requires courage to will repetition.
He who does not grasp that life is repetition and that this is the beauty of life, has condemned himself and deserves nothing better than what will happen to him.
Repetition is actuality and the earnestness of existence. He who wills repetition is genuinely mature.
Most people pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it.
It seems essential, in relationships and all tasks, that we concentrate only on what is most significant and important.

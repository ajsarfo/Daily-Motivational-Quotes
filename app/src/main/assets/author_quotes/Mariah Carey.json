I am thinking of you in my sleepless solitude tonight. If it's wrong to love you, then my heart just won't let me be right cause I'm drowned in you and I won't pull through without you by my side.

Pregnancy was probably the best and the hardest thing I'll ever go through. I know for a lot of women, it can be wonderful and relatively easy.
I'm proud of what I am and who I am, and I'm just going to be myself.
Whatever you're going through in your life, don't ever give up.
It's kinda like being on a roller coaster. If you don't get on the ride, you won't experience the adventure.

Spread your wings and prepare to fly for you have become a butterfly. Oh fly abandonedly into the sun. If you should return to me, we truly were meant to be. So spread your wings and fly butterfly.
If you see me as just the princess then you misunderstand who I am and what I have been through.
Don't be afraid to fly,spread your wings open up the door. So much more outside don't be afraid to fly.
Spread your wings and prepare to fly for you have become a butterfly.
I can change it, I can't make you stay if you need to believe.

Lord knows . Dreams are hard to follow . But don't let anyone . Tear them away . Hold On . There will be tomorrow . In time you'll find the way.
You brighten up the moon and stars at night You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky You bring new meaning to my life, now I believe in miracles
But I didn't wanna face the truth . That I was only being used . And you was just fronting .
We promised to keep it casual . But at times it can be so difficult . This relationship, so untypical . And I can't understand .
First you love ma and then you leave me . And then I'm falling back in your arms . There's no conclusion, it's so deceiving . Cause I get taken in by your charms .
You've got me feeling emotions . Deeper than I've ever dreamed of . You've got me feeling emotions .
You really have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength, and say 'I'm proud of who I am and what I am, and I'm just going to be myself.
I know I can be diva-ish sometimes, but I have to be in control. The nature of my life, the nature of what I do, is divadom, it really is.
In this world, I call the shots and I think I know best.

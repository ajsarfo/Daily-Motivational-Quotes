Every living being is an engine geared to the wheelwork of the universe. Though seemingly affected only by its immediate surrounding, the sphere of external influence extends to infinite distance.
The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences beating upon us to cripple the creative mind. Be aloneâ€”that is the secret of invention: be alone, that is when ideas are born.
Anti-social behavior is a trait of intelligence in a world full of conformists.
The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.
The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain.
Modern science says: 'The sun is the past, the earth is the present, the moon is the future.' From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom.
With ideas it is like with dizzy heights you climb: At first they cause you discomfort and you are anxious to get down, distrustful of your own powers; but soon the remoteness of the turmoil of life and the inspiring influence of the altitude calm your blood; your step gets firm and sure and you begin to look - for dizzier heights.

The harness of waterfalls is the most economical method known for drawing energy from the sun.
When wireless is fully applied the earth will be converted into a huge brain, capable of response in every one of its parts.
Alternate currents, especially of high frequencies, pass with astonishing freedom through even slightly rarefied gases. The upper strata of the air are rarefied. To reach a number of miles out into space requires the overcoming of difficulties of a merely mechanical nature.
As in nature, all is ebb and tide, all is wave motion, so it seems that in all branches of industry, alternating currents—electric wave motion—will have the sway.
We wind a simple ring of iron with coils; we establish the connections to the generator, and with wonder and delight we note the effects of strange forces which we bring into play, which allow us to transform, to transmit and direct energy at will.
Electric power is everywhere present in unlimited quantities and can drive the world's machinery without the need of coal, oil, or any other fuel.
The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention.
Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is mine.

The only good thing about the good old days is they're gone.

I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.

When you think of the good old days, think one word: dentistry.

Nothing is more responsible for the good old days than a bad memory.

Sooner or later the world will have to return to the good old days when we fought wars and killed people the old-fashioned way, one at a time.

We are always yapping about the 'Good Old Days' and how we look back and enjoy it, but I tell you there is a lot of hooey to it. There is a whole lot of all our past lives that wasn't so hot.

And luckily, therefore the good old days return. The traditional art of driving counts again, and it is all about good tactics, skills and reflexes instead of simple power.
Jacky Ickx
We over-exaggerate yesterday. We either think it was better or worse than it was - you know, the good old days. We over-estimate tomorrow; we think we can do more than we can - always. And that's why we put off everything till tomorrow.

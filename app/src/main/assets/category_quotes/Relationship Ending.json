It's called a breakup because it's broken is designed to help you not only get out of an unsatisfying relationship but to get over it so that you can be ready for the better things in life that are coming your way.

Real heartbreak is unmistakable, from the intensity of the emotional pain it causes, to the totality with which it takes over our mind and even our body. We think of nothing else.

One of the most unfortunate realities of heartbreak is that our 'natural' responses often do us more harm than good.

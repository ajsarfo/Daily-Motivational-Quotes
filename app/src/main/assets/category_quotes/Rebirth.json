The creation of a new heart, the renewing of a right spirit is an omnipotent work of God. Leave it to the Creator. He which hath begun a good work in you will perfect it unto that day.
Henry Drummond
Rebirth is neither born of blood nor flesh or human origin. But born of God.

Reincarnation is not what a lot of people think. Yes, we are eternal. No, everyone does not attain enlightenment; it's not necessary; life is smarter than we are.
Frederick Lindemann
You will be reborn. You will come from the inner to the outer again. This process goes on indefinitely.

Rebirth is inevitable so long as one has desires. It is like taking the soul from one pillow-case and putting it into another. Only one or two out of many men can be found who are free from all desires.
Sarada Devi
The birth and rebirth of all nature, The passing of winter and spring, We share with the life universal, Rejoice in the magical ring.

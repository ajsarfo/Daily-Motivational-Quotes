All married couples should learn the art of battle as they should learn the art of making love. Good battle is objective and honest never vicious or cruel. Good battle is healthy and constructive, and brings to a marriage the principles of equal partnership.

As you become husband and wife, prepare to welcome a lot of strife. Each others faults you will point out, you will fight and argue without a doubt. Don't even bother trying to find a solution, this is marriage life's toughest institution.

A young woman, newly wed, may find herself in the delightful position of wanting to do nothing without the company of her darling husband. She may indeed discover that she spends all her waking hours with her fellow to the exclusion of every other friend or family member. This is understandable, but wholly unacceptable, to society.

Just because you have got married, it is no excuse to stop taking pride in your appearance. If you don't respect your own body, then it will be difficult for your partner to. Eat a healthy diet, and do some form of exercise at least once a week. You could even find a fun activity to do together.

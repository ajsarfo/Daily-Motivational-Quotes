Politeness is not always a sign of wisdom; but the want of it always leaves room for a suspicion of folly, if folly and imprudence are the same.
Walter Savage Landor
There is no policy like politeness; and a good manner is the best thing in the world either to get a good name, or to supply the want of it.
Edward Bulwer-Lytton
Politeness goes far, yet costs nothing.
Samuel Smiles
In truth, politeness is artificial good humor, it covers the natural want of it, and ends by rendering habitual a substitute nearly equivalent to the real virtue.
Thomas Jefferson
Good and strong will. Mechanism must precede science (learning). Also in morals and religion? Too much discipline makes one narrow and kills proficiency. Politeness belongs, not to discipline, but to polish, and thus comes last.
Immanuel Kant
(Politeness is) a tacit agreement that people's miserable defects, whether moral or intellectual, shall on either side be ignored and not be made the subject of reproach.
Arthur Schopenhauer
[Politeness costs nothing.]. . . . Nothing, that is to him that shows it; but it often costs the world very dear.

Virtue, perhaps, is nothing more than politeness of soul.

Politeness is an inexpensive way of making friends.
William Feather
There is a politeness of the heart; this is closely allied to love.

Politeness is sometimes a great tax upon sincerity.

One of the greatest victories you can gain over someone is to beat him at politeness.
Josh Billings
Politeness is the chief sign of culture.
Baltasar Gracian
Politeness is one of those advantages which we never estimate rightly but by the inconvenience of its loss.
Samuel Johnson
True politeness consists in being easy one's self, and in making every one about one as easy as one can.
Alexander Pope
True politeness is to social life what oil is to machinery, a thing to oil the ruts and grooves of existence. False politeness can shine without warming and glitter without vivifying.
Frances Harper
Politeness has been well defined as benevolence in small things.
Thomas B. Macaulay
A polite enemy is just as difficult to discredit, as a rude friend is to protect.
Bryant McGill
All Politeness is owing to Liberty. We polish one another, and rub off our Corners and rough Sides by a sort of amicable Collision. To restrain this, is inevitably to bring a Rust upon Mens Understandings.
Anthony Ashley-Cooper
Home is the place where true politeness tells.
Julia McNair Wright
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
Colette
Politeness can at once be the indifferent affliction of the â€˜civilized' as well as a subterfuge for the designed offence.

Politeness is the poison of collaboration.
Edwin Land
Politeness and an affable address are our best introduction.

Joseph Joubert
Politeness is like an air-cushionâ€”there may be nothing in it, but it wonderfully eases the joltings along the rough road of life.
H.W. Beecher
Politeness is organized indifference.
Paul Valery
Politeness is to human nature what warmth is to wax.
Arthur Schopenhauer
Politeness is half good manners and half good lying.
Mary Wilson Little
There is no accomplishment so easy to acquire as politeness, and none more profitable.
Henry Wheeler Shaw
Politeness is fictitious benevolence. Depend upon it, the want of it never fails to produce something disagreeable to one or other.
Samuel Johnson
Our morality seems to be only a check on the ultimate domination of force, just as our politeness is a check on the impulse of every pig to put his feet in the trough.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
Politeness [is] a sign of dignity, not subservience.
Theodore Roosevelt
Politeness is the art of choosing among one's real thoughts.
Abel Stevens
The highest perfection of politeness is only a beautiful edifice, built, from the base to the dome, of ungraceful and gilded forms of charitable and unselfish lying.
Mark Twain
Politeness is as much concerned in answering letters within a reasonable time, as it is in returning a bow, immediately.
Lord Chesterfield
It is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing to be rude. To make enemies by unnecessary and willful incivility, is just as insane a proceeding as to set your house on fire. For politeness is like a counter--an avowedly false coin, with which it is foolish to be stingy.
Arthur Schopenhauer
Politeness makes one appear outwardly as they should be within.
Jean De La Bruyere

I used to watch all the couples going by . Feeling left out and so alone . But now I feel so much a part of them . Because I've got a man of my own . It's never too late to fall in love again . And I know, and I know . That it's true . You treat me with so much tenderness, love and respect . And I just love everything that you do.
Carole King
I used to hide in a party crowd . Bottled up inside . Feeling so left out . Standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes . With my frozen smile . And my lighted fuse . Now every time I start to feel like that . I roll my heart out like a welcome mat . Oh watch me go . I'm a happy girl . Everybody knows . That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see . In the whole wide world . Is a happy girl.

I don’t feel like feeling anymore . I sit here in my thoughts . Trying to make sense . Of what I am supposed to think. . But all I get is pain . From the heart to my head . A knife digging in . To the very core of my soul.

I've always loved the first day of school better than the last day of school. Firsts are best because they are beginnings.

I'm not going.
Kate Berube

On the first day of school, you got to be real careful where you sit. You walk into the classroom and just plunk your stuff down on any old desk, and the next thing you know the teacher is saying, 'I hope you all like where you're sitting, because these are your permanent seats.
Jeff Kinney
First day of school, make sure that you know your locker combination.

Taisen Deshimaru
Wisdom begins in wonder.
Socrates
And this was the cause of my suffering when I was sent to school. For all of a sudden I found my world vanishing around me, giving place to wooden benches and straight walls staring at me with the blank stare of the blind. But the legend is that eating of the fruit of knowledge is not consonant with dwelling in paradise. Therefore men's children have to be banished from their paradise into a realm of death dominated by the decency of a tailoring department. So my mind had to accept the tight-fitting encasement of the school which, being like the shoes of a mandarin woman, pinched and bruised my nature on all sides and at every movement.
Rabindranath Tagore
What if they mispronounce my last name and everyone laughs? What if my teacher doesn't make her D's like Mom taught me? What if I spend the whole day without a friend?

My first year has been as disappointing as it was rewarding... I have lost and found hope, reviewed and revised, and finally concluded that my presence here is much more important that I had thought it would be.
Catherine McTamaney
Our problem as educators is that far too often we begin the academic year worrying more about our courses and about our academic responsibilities than about our students, those fragile human beings who sit across from us and stare, waiting to learn and eager to know.
Frank Pajares

You're perfect when you're comfortable being yourself.

Ken Robinson
Every day is the first day of school.
Dr. Edoardo Zeloni Magelli
My number one goal at the end of the first day is not that they know the rules and consequences. It's that they're excited to be part of the class. That they run home to their parents and say, 'Oh my gosh. I have the best teacher. I have this awesome class. It's going to be great.
Michael Linsin

Joseph Bruce
And I had a dream it blows the autumn through my head . It felt like the first day of school . But I was going to the moon instead . And I walked down the hall . With the notebooks they got for me . My dad led me through the house . My mom drank instant coffee . And I knew that I would crash . But I didn't want to tell them . There are just some moments when your family makes sense .
Robert Peter Williams
And I know that this is new . Like your first day of school . And you're feeling awkward . Like you miss your home . And it leaves you with an empty feeling .

Greener than the first day at school . Wiser now but I'm still a fool . Packed my bags and I left too soon .

And Mother is cutting lunches, . There are only four as a rule, . But to-day another is added, . For Baby is going to school. . ‘You’ll take her on Laddie between you, . And hold her tight at the creek.” . And Mother parts with her darling . With a kiss on her dimpled cheek.
Alice Guerin Crist
An old man's thought of School; . An old man, gathering youthful memories and blooms, that youth itself cannot. . Now only do I know you! . O fair auroral skies! O morning dew upon the grass! . And these I see--these sparkling eyes, . These stores of mystic meaning--these young lives, . Building, equipping, like a fleet of ships--immortal ships! .Soon to sail out over the measureless seas, . On the Soul's voyage.
Walt Whitman
In this little school . Life goes so sweetly, . Day on azure day . Is lost completely. . No one thinks too much, . Or worries greatly. . In a pleasant shade . We dream sedately. . There's no struggle here . Or conflict showing; . Only the sweet pain . Of young limbs growing.
Lesbia Harford
School, School, School, . Without any frightening rule, . It’s not a place for fools and cools, . But a place for cute and artfuls. . It is the time when our pencils get shorten, . And notebooks get fat. . Our crayons get broken, . And erasers get flat. . Teachers here are very kind, . But wrong doings, they do mind. . Infused into us is not fear, . School days are very dear. . Studying in a school is not just a pleasure, . It’s truly a lifetime treasure.

A lot of the time when people get married in the infatuation, it will go down. That is inevitable. The infatuation stage will not last forever.
Tamera Mowry
Infatuation is when you find somebody who is absolutely perfect. Love is when you realise that they aren't and it doesn't matter.
Anonymous
love is reliable. infatuation is temporary.
Ann Hood
There is, in lovers, a certain infatuation of egotism; they will have a witness of their happiness, cost that witness what it may.
Charlotte Bronte
Infatuation is measured in pleasure. Love is measured in pain.
Anthony Marais
Irrational crushes, infatuations, or obsessions. Whatever you want to label it, it's important to reach out to others.
Janeane Garofalo
Indeed, infatuation thrives on image (while love thrives on knowledge).
Chana Levitan
The evil of infatuation is illustrated by the drunkard.
John Bartholomew Gough
Infatuation is the language of a beautiful eye upon a sensitive heart.
Joseph R. Bartlett
Infatuation is like a drug that gives you the best high yet gives you the worst headache after.
Luke Blaise
Infatuation cannot be sustained indefinitely, my friend. Love that embraces the entire person is a monumental gift that takes time to grow.
Joan Bauer
Love- the infatuation kind- 'he's so handsome, she's so beautiful'- that can shrivel. As soon as something goes wrong, that kind of love can fly out the window.
Mitch Albom
I think infatuation is like a garden. If tended and cared for, it grows into love. If neglected or abused it dies. The only way to have eternal love is to never let your heart forget what it's like to live without it.
Sherrilyn Kenyon
Sometimes when you look back on a situation, you realize it wasn't all you thought it was. A beautiful girl walked into your life. You fell in love. Or did you? Perhaps, it was only a childish infatuation, or maybe just a brief moment of vanity.
Henry Bromell
Infatuation was a good thing. It gave spice to life, and added to its enjoyment... But it was different from love. Love was worth everything, and couldn't be exchanged for anything.
Paulo Coelho
This was the mark of deep infatuation, he thought: the desire to watch a woman talk just to see her lips move, to be around her.
Hugh Howey
Love sees clearly, and seeing, loves on. But infatuation is blind; when it gains sight, it dies.
Mary Roberts Rinehart
No one can understand love who has not experienced infatuation. And no one can understand infatuation, no matter how many times he has experienced it.
Mignon McLaughlin
Infatuation is not quite the same thing as love; it's more like love's shady second cousin who's always borrowing money and can't hold down a job.
Elizabeth Gilbert
Infatuation's just another word for not seeing clearly.
Jodi Picoult

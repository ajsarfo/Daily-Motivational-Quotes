The end of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom. For in all the states of created beings capable of law, where there is no law, there is no freedom.
John Locke
The safety of the people shall be the highest law.
Marcus Tullius Cicero
There's a natural law of karma that vindictive people, who go out of their way to hurt others, will end up broke and alone.
Sylvester Stallone
At his best, man is the noblest of all animals; separated from law and justice he is the worst.
Aristotle
I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.
Robert A. Heinlein
We cannot expect people to have respect for law and order until we teach respect to those we have entrusted to enforce those laws.

Maxwell Anderson
The law was made for one thing alone, for the exploitation of those who don't understand it.
Bertolt Brecht
The law isn't justice. It's a very imperfect mechanism. If you press exactly the right buttons and are also lucky, justice may show up in the answer. A mechanism is all the law was ever intended to be.
Raymond Chandler
If there were no bad people, there would be no good lawyers.

Dwight D. Eisenhower
Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the laws.
Plato
We must reject the idea that every time a law's broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.
Ronald Reagan
It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can keep him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important.
Martin Luther King, Jr.
No man is above the law and no man is below it; nor do we ask any man's permission when we ask him to obey it. Obedience to the law is demanded as a right; not asked as a favor.
Theodore Roosevelt
An unjust law is itself a species of violence. Arrest for its breach is more so.

Law is a Bottomless-Pit, it is a Cormorant, a Harpy, that devours every thing.
John Arbuthnot
Surely we will not dare say that these laws are unjust, or rather, that they are not laws at all. For it seems to me that an unjust law is no law at all.
Augustine of Hippo
Any law that takes hold of a man's daily life cannot prevail in a community, unless the vast majority of the community are actively in favor of it. The laws that are the most operative are the laws which protect life.
Henry Ward Beecher
No civilization would ever have been possible without a framework of stability, to provide the wherein for the flux of change. Foremost among the stabilizing factors, more enduring than customs, manners and traditions, are the legal systems that regulate our life in the world and our daily affairs with each other.
Hannah Arendt
Laws, like houses, lean on one another.
Edmund Burke

Laws are not invented. They grow out of circumstances.
Azarias
Laws are not masters, but servants, and he rules them, who obeys them.

There is a Law that man should love his neighbor as himself. In a few hundred years it should be as natural to mankind as breathing or the upright gait; but if he does not learn it he must perish.
Alfred Adler
As labor creates the wealth of the country, we demand the passage of such laws as may be necessary to protect it in all its rights.
John Peter Altgeld
Law; an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community
St. Thomas Aquinas
Judicial bodies provide a forum for truth telling
Louise Arbour
The rule of law in place of force, always basic to my thinking, now takes on a new relevance in a world where, if war is to go, only law can replace it.
Roger Nash Baldwin
Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour ...
Charlotte Bronte
The law is hard, but it is the law.
Cassandra Clare
We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist natural ones.
Jules Verne
Law applied to its extreme is the greatest injustice
Cicero Marcus Tullius
There are laws. There are rules. And when you break them, there are consequences. Laws of nature and laws of life. Laws of love and laws of death.
Amy Harmon
No great idea in its beginning can ever be within the law. How can it be within the law? The law is stationary. The law is fixed. The law is a chariot wheel that binds us all regardless of conditions or place or time.
Emma Goldman
But the law is an odd thing. For instance, one country in Europe has a law that requires all its bakers to sell bread at the exact same price. A certain island has a law that forbids anyone from removing its fruit. And a town not too far from where you live has a law that bars me from coming within five miles of its borders.

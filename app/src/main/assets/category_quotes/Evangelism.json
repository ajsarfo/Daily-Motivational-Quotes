Most people do not come to Christ as an immediate response to a sermon they hear in a crowded setting. They come to Christ because of the influence of an individual.","name" : "John Macarthur"},{"message" : "Our task is to live our personal communion with Christ with such intensity as to make it contagious.","name" : "Paul Tournier"},{"message" : "You never know till you try to reach them how accessible men are; but you must approach each man by the right door.","name" : "Henry Ward Beecher"},{"message" : "Evangelism is not a professional job for a few trained men, but is instead the unrelenting responsibility of every person who belongs to the company of Jesus.","name" : "D. Elton Trueblood"},{"message" : "The Church exists for nothing else but to draw men into Christ, to make them little Christs. If they are not doing that, all the cathedrals, clergy, missions, sermons, even the Bible itself, are simply a waste of time. God became Man for no other purpose.","name" : "C. S. Lewis"},{"message" : "We email, Facebook, tweet and text with people who are going to spend eternity in either heaven or hell. Our lives are too short to waste on mere temporal conversations when massive eternal realities hang in the balance. Just as you and I have no guarantee that we will live through the day, the people around us are not guaranteed tomorrow either. So let's be intentional about sewing the threads of the gospel into the fabric of our conversations every day, knowing that it will not always be easy, yet believing that eternity will always be worth it.","name" : "David Platt"},{"message" : "Evangelism is more about being than being perfect.","name" : "Rev. Kellen Roggenbuck"},{"message" : "Evangelization is a process of bringing the gospel to people where they are, not where you would like them to be… When the gospel reaches a people where they are, their response to the gospel is the church in a new place.","name" : "Vincent Donovan"},{"message" : "Any method of evangelism will work if God is in it.","name" : "Leonard Ravenhill"},{"message" : "If you had the cure to cancer wouldn't you share it? ...

He whom you cleave unto is exalted, and has exalted you. Run to and fro, and be known unto all nations.","name" : "Augustine of Hippo"},{"message" : "New Evangelization is the work of the whole Church — lay, ordained, and consecrated. It’s about friends, family, and co-workers reaching out to one another and proclaiming the truth of Christ using all available means — conversation, personal witness, media, and the vast array of intellectual and spiritual riches the Church has built up in her two-thousand-year history. It’s about simple acts of kindness, simple challenges issued in love, and simple questions asked with sincerity. More fundamentally, the New Evangelization is more for the baptized than the unbaptized. It’s for those who’ve been inadequately catechized but all too adequately secularized, and it’s for those who’ve been de-Christianized in the very process of being sacramentalized.","name" : "Scott Hahn"},{"message" : "Show me that you are redeemed, and I will believe in your Redeemer.","name" : "Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche"},{"message" : "Evangelism is just one beggar telling another beggar where to find the bread.","name" : "Daniel Thambyrajah Niles"},{"message" : "Jesus teaches us another way.

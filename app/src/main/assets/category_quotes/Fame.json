The longer a man's fame is likely to last, the longer it will be in coming.

Alanis Morissette
If you wanna be famous, then it's okay if the music is fake, because fame isn't real.
Josh Homme
With fame, you can't trust everybody. You can't depend on them being there for you as a person. They will only be there because of what you've got you as a person. They will only be there because of what you've got and what you can bring to their life. It's not a relationship-it's a leech.
Chris Brown

One of the downsides of being famous is that folks pay far more attention to you than they should. American celebrities are constantly under surveillance, and every word they say is subject to scrutiny. So, be careful what you wish for if you desire fame. No human being should be a goldfish.
Bill O'Reilly
Worldly fame is but a breath of wind that blows now this way, and now that, and changes name as it changes direction.

Fame is indeed beautiful and benign and gentle and satisfying, but happiness is something at once tender and brilliant beyond all things.
Mary MacLane
There's a funny thing about fame. The truth is you run as fast as you can towards it because it's everything you want. Not just the fame but what it represents, meaning work, meaning opportunity. And then you get there, and it's shocking how immediately you become enveloped in this world that is incredibly restricting.
George Clooney

Bodhidharma
In general, when you have success on the field, you're more popular, and you have that fame that comes with it. You realize you're in the public eye more, and you've got to be a little bit more careful about some of the things you're doing out in public and make sure you're smart about the things you say.
Aaron Rodgers

Fame can be just so annoying because people are so critical of you. You can't just say, 'hi'. You say hi and people whisper' man did you see the way she said hi? What an attitude.
Juliette Lewis
Of all the possessions of this life fame is the noblest; when the body has sunk into the dust the great name still lives.

Publius Cornelius Tacitus
If you come to fame not understanding who you are, it will define who you are.
Oprah Winfrey
Never underestimate the power of being popular in pop culture. You have to be able to do something. You can have a good seat at the restaurant, but you still have to pay for the meal. Fame is important, but to be rich is more important.
Gene Simmons

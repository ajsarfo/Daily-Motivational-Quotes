George Sweeting
Why is it that men can be bastards and women must wear pearls and smile?
Lynn Hecht Schafran
White people now tan to get darker; and black people wear their hair like white people. We are all confused. Deep down we admire each other, but we don't accept it. The silly thing is that color of one's skin is simply evolution's answer for dealing with different rates of exposure to the sun.

Ella J. Baker
I was thinking about all the honors that are showered on me in the theater, how everyone wishes to shake my hand or get an autograph, a real hero you'd naturally think. However, when I reach a hotel, I am refused permission to ride on the passenger elevator, I cannot enter the dining room for my meals, and am Jim Crowed generally... I know this to be an unbelievable custom.

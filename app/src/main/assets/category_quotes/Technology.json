Bill Gates
Our technological powers increase, but the side effects and potential hazards also escalate.

Technology gives us power, but it does not and cannot tell us how to use that power. Thanks to technology, we can instantly communicate across the world, but it still doesn't help us know what to say.
Jonathan Sacks
Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.
Aldous Huxley
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
Arthur C. Clarke
Technology... is a queer thing. It brings you great gifts with one hand, and it stabs you in the back with the other.

Pope Paul VI
Technology...the knack of so arranging the world that we don't have to experience it.

Tim Berners-Lee
Technology is a word that describes something that doesn't work yet.
Douglas Adams

Technology presumes there's just one right way to do things and there never is.
Robert M. Pirsig
If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence, our servant may prove to be our executioner.
Omar N. Bradley
Technology has to be invented or adopted.
Jared Diamond
All of our technology is completely unnecessary to a happy life.
Tom Hodgkinson
Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master.
Christian Lous Lange
Technology is anything that wasn't around when you were born.
Alan Kay
Technology will definitely solve all our problems, but in the process it will create brand new ones. But that's O.K. because the most you can expect from life is to get to solve better and better problems.
Scott Adams
Technology is teaching us to be human again.
Simon Mainwaring
Digital technology allows us a much larger scope to tell stories that were pretty much the grounds of the literary media.
George Lucas

We can't blame the technology when we make mistakes.
Tim Berners-Lee
As information technology restructures the work situation, it abstracts thought from action.

Technology is destructive only in the hands of people who do not realize that they are one and the same process as the universe.
Alan W. Watts
Our technology forces us to live mythically.
Marshall McLuhan
As technology advances in complexity and scope, fear becomes more primitive.
Don DeLillo
Technology is dominated by two types of people: those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand.
Archibald Putt
The purpose of technology is not to confuse the brain but to serve the body.
William S. Burroughs
For any new technology there is always controversy and there always some fear associated with it. I think that's just the price of being first sometimes.
Hugh Grant
If it keeps up, man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-button finger.
Frank Lloyd Wright
Technology - with all its promise and potential - has gotten so far beyond human control that its threatening the future of humankind.
Kim J. Vicente
Technology means you can now do amazing things easily; but you couldn't easily do them legally.
Lawrence Lessig
The advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you don't really even notice it, so it's part of everyday life.
Bill Gates
New technology is useful, but it's inefficient and ugly; it knows it'll be obsolete by lunchtime tomorrow, so it has no incentive to be anything else.
Tom Holt
Technology makes things faster and more cost-effective, but it's not perfect. It requires you to be as flexible as you can be.
John Phillips
As technology advances, it reverses the characteristics of every situation again and again. The age of automation is going to be the age of do it yourself.
Marshall McLuhan
Technology breeds crime and we are constantly trying to develop technology to stay one step ahead of the person trying to use it negatively.
Frank Abagnale

David Lynch

Ryan Storey
To me, it’s not that I’m a 100 percent nonsmoker, but I cut down the tobacco that I do use. To me, that’s a plus. If it eventually leads me to being a 100 percent nonsmoker forever, great. If all it does is cut me back, that’s fine, too.
Travis Barker
Either quit smoking or get a new lighter.

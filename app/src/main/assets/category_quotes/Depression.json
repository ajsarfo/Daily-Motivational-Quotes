Bill Wilson
Depression is the inability to construct a future.
Dr. Rollo May
A lot of people don't realize that depression is an illness. I don't wish it on anyone, but if they would know how it feels, I swear they would think twice before they just shrug it.
Jonathan Davis
That's the thing about depression: A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight. But depression is so insidious, and it compounds daily, that it's impossible to ever see the end. The fog is like a cage without a key.
Elizabeth Wurtzel
Depression occurs when one looks back with no pride, and looks forward with no hope.
Robert Frost
Depression is melancholy minus its charms, the animation, the fits.

Depression is something that makes you lose your sight.
Michael Schenker
Depression scares people off. It makes me laugh that it has that kind of effect.
Siobhan Fahey

Rube Goldberg
If you feel depressed you shouldn't go out on the street because it will show on your face and you'll give it to others. Misery is a communicable disease.
Martha Graham
People with depression have something very valuable to teach us... how to live when it doesn't ever feel good.
Kay Warren
There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds.

Dr. Rollo May
Sometimes It's easier to pretend that you don't care, than to admit it's killing you.

Dr. R. W. Shepherd
A new study found that people who are depressed have a greater risk of stroke. Well that should cheer them up.

The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
Losing your life is not the worst thing that can happen. The worst thing is to lose your reason for living.

Before any great achievement, some measure of depression is very usual.
Charles Spurgeon
The only thing more exhausting than being depressed is pretending that you're not.

When you feel worried and depressed, consciously form a smile on your face and act upbeat until the happy feeling becomes genuine.
Jonathan Lockwood Huie
Sometimes it's heavy like you're carrying an elephant. Sometimes it's dark; you wonder if you'll ever see light. Sometimes it's bleak; you wonder if you'll make it through. And some days there are no words to describe it.
Tonia Funk Brassell
Having depression is like being trapped in a really bad thunderstorm. You don't know when it's going to hit, you never know how long it's going to last, and when it finally passes, you're left to survey the damages and pick up the pieces.
Tiffany Johnson
Depression is like a bruise that never goes away. A bruise in your mind.
Jeffrey Eugenides
Depression is frustrating. It's knowing there's so much to be grateful for and happy about and to enjoy, but you just can't get there.
Allie Griffin
Depression is like quicksand â€” the more you try to escape on your own, the deeper you sink. Use the supports, tools and resources thrown at you from those on the outside.
Jamie Awtry McClintic
Depression is nourished by a lifetime of ungrieved and unforgiven hurts.
Penelope Sweet
There is nothing more depressing, than having everything, and still feeling sad.
Janet Jackson
Depression is like drowning. Except you can see everyone else around you breathing.

My unhappiness has become a steady, calm quiet sort of misery. It is always with me and when for a moment something or other stirs me from its immediate ravages (thank God that is still possible) — I wonder at its absence.
Lorraine Hansberry
I am now so depressed I have not an Idea to put to paper — my hand feels like lead — and yet it is an unpleasant numbness it does not take away the pain of existence.
John Keats
I am so angry with myself because I cannot do what I should like to do, and at such a moment one feels as if one were lying bound hand and foot at the bottom of a deep dark well, utterly helpless.
Vincent Van Gogh
The gray drizzle of horror induced by depression takes on the quality of physical pain. But it is not an immediately identifiable pain, like that of a broken limb. It may be more accurate to say that despair, owing to some evil trick played upon the sick brain by the inhabiting psyche, comes to resemble the diabolical discomfort of being imprisoned in a fiercely overheated room. And because no breeze stirs this caldron, because there is no escape from this smothering confinement, it is entirely natural that the victim begins to think ceaselessly of oblivion.
William Styron
Sometimes one has simply to endure a period of depression for what it may hold of illumination if one can live through it, attentive to what it exposes or demands.
May Sarton
Depression is a disorder of the ‘I,’ failing in your own eyes relative to your goals.
Martin Seligman
I am now the most miserable man living.
Abraham Lincoln
There are different degrees of feeling when you have a Black Dog in your life. At one end of the scale you may feel sad, flat, teary, or blue, and at the other, you are devoid of feeling altogether and life is overwhelmingly difficult.
Matthew Johnstone
Everything passes away — suffering, pain, blood, hunger, pestilence. The sword will pass away too, but the stars will still remain when the shadows of our presence and our deeds have vanished from the earth. There is no man who does not know that.
Mikhail Bulgakov
Depression is the flaw in love. To be creatures who love, we must be creatures who can despair at what we lose, and depression is the mechanism of that despair.
Andrew Solomon
My depression had grown on me as that vine had conquered the oak; it had been a sucking thing that had wrapped itself around me, ugly and more alive than I. It had had a life of its own that bit by bit asphyxiated all of my life out of me. At the worst stage of major depression, I had moods that I knew were not my moods: they belonged to the depression, as surely as the leaves on that tree's high branches belonged to the vine.
Andrew Solomon
I knew that the sun was rising and setting, but little of its light reached me. I felt myself sagging under what was much stronger than I; first I could not use my ankles, and then I could not control my knees, and then my waist began to break under the strain, and then my shoulders turned in, and in the end I was compacted and fetal, depleted by this thing that was crushing me without holding me. Its tendrils threatened to pulverize my mind and my courage and my stomach, and crack my bones and desiccate my body. It went on glutting itself on me when there seemed nothing left to feed it.
Andrew Solomon
It wearies me, you say it wearies you; . But how I caught it, found it, or came by it . What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born . I am to learn; . And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, . That I have much ado to know myself.
William Shakespeare
I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, . And Mourners to and fro . Kept treading — treading — till it seemed .
Emily Dickinson
Instead of medication, . I want sunshine . & birdsongs . — the kind of laughter . that begins in my chest . & tumbles . out & across . my frame like waves . lapping at the shore of a beach.
M.J. Fievre
Well, I can usually come our of it when I have the blues, . But now I'm so depressed that I have nothing more to lose.
Bill Granse
Of course, despair is not your friend . or your enemy, you mustn't blame him! . He is your persistent creditor, and you? . You are the gambler with your soul as the stakes.
Lin Huiyin
The sickness of desire, that in dark days . Looks on the imagination of despair, . Forgetteth man, and stinteth God his praise; . Nor but in sleep findeth a cure for care.
Robert Seymour Bridges
It gives, to think that our immortal being . No more shall need such garments; and yet man, . As long as he shall be the child of earth, . Might almost 'weep to have' what he may lose, . Nor be himself extinguished, but survive, . Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate.
William Wordsworth
Oh, though oft depressed and lonely, . All my fears are laid aside, . If I but remember only .
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
There was no water in my eyes, but my spirits were depressed . And my heart lay like a sodden, soggy doughnut in my breast.
Eugene Field
Dispirited became our friend — .
William Schwenck Gilbert
A grief that kept her ever brooding yet . And wholly melancholy and depressed, — . Nor yet could she find sleep by night nor rest .
James Whitcomb Riley
I sat depressed; till, later, . My Love came; . But something in the chamber . Dimmed our flame, — .
Thomas Hardy
Exasperated, a drunk that sees things doubled, . I stumbled home, slammed the door, terrified, . sick, depressed, mind feverish and troubled, . wounded by mystery, the absurd, outside! . In vain my reason tried to take command, . its efforts useless in the tempest’s roar, . my soul, a mastless barge, danced, and danced, .
Charles Baudelaire
But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell . I know right now you can't tell . But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see . A different side of me . I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired . I know right now you don't care . But soon enough you're gonna think of me .
Robert Thomas
I'm holding on . Why is everything so heavy? . Holding on . So much more than I can carry . I keep dragging around what's bringing me down .
Brad Delson; Chester Bennington; Julia Michaels; Justin Tranter; Mike Shinoda; Dave Farrell
I don't like my mind right now . Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary . Wish that I could slow things down .
Brad Delson; Chester Bennington; Julia Michaels; Justin Tranter; Mike Shinoda; Dave Farrell
I never had a place to call my own . I never had a home . Ain't nobody callin' my phone . Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind? .
Alessia Caracciolo; Arjun Ivatury; Khalid Robinson; Sir Robert Bryson Hall II
There are peaks, there are valleys. But they're all kind of carved and smoothed out, and it feels like a low level of despair you live in. Where you're not getting any answers, but you're living OK. And you can smile at the office. You know? But it's a low level of despair.
Jim Carrey
I look inside myself and see my heart is black . I see my red door and must have it painted black . maybe then I’ll fade away and not have to face the facts .
Keith Richards; Mick Jagger
I hurt myself today . To see if I still feel . I focus on the pain . The only thing that's real . The needle tears a hole . The old familiar sting . Try to kill it all away .
Trent Reznor
There's a black crow sitting across from me . His wiry legs are crossed . He's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss . Whatever could it be .
Justin Deyarmond Edison Vernon
In my dark times I've still got some problems I know . Driving too fast but just moving to slow . And I've got something I've been trying to let go .
Jason Quenneville; Edward Christopher Sheeran; Abel Tesfaye
Every night I just want to go out, . Get out of my head . Every day I don't want to get up, .
Paul McCartney
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow .
Roland Orzabal
All alone it was always there you see . And even on my own . It was always standing next to me . I can see it coming from the edge of the room . Creeping in the streetlight holding my hand in the pale gloom .
James Ellis Ford; Florence Leontine Mary Welch
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels . I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills . And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf . No farewell .
Amy Victoria Wadge; Edward Christopher Sheeran; Timothy Lee McKenzie
The worst part of depression is that it dulls every positive feeling but intensifies every negative one. Joy is muted; sorrow is amplified.

Do I look depressed? People are yelling 'jump' at me, walking through the mall.
Ken Willidau
What, then, is depression? It is hysteria of the spirit.
Søren Kierkegaard
There is something unexplainable in depression [Tungsind]. A person with a sorrow or a worry knows why he sorrows or worries. If a depressed person is asked what the reason is, what it is that weighs [tynge] on him, he will answer: I do not know; I cannot explain it. Therein lies the limitlessness of depression.
Søren Kierkegaard
[D]epression is something real that one does not delete with the stroke of the pen.
Søren Kierkegaard
To destroy an undesirable rate of mental vibration, concentrate on the opposite vibration to the one to be suppressed... What is the source of sadness but feebleness of the mind? What gives it power but the want of reason? Rouse yourself to the combat, and it quits the field before you strike.
Khemetic Saying
Depression never brings me what I want; . My virtue will be warped and marred by it. . If there is a remedy when trouble strikes, . What reason is there for despondency? . And if there is no help for it, .
Shantideva
Despair is a mental state which exaggerates not only our misery but also our weakness.
Marquis De Vauvenargues
It is despair, and despair alone, that begets heroic hope, absurd hope, mad hope.
Miguel de Unamuno
Many an attack of depression is nothing but the expression of regret at having to be virtuous.
Wilhelm Stekel
Men have been depressed now for many years in their male and resplendent selves, depressed into dejection and almost abjection.
D.H. Lawrence
Despair is the absolute extreme of self-love. It is reached when a man deliberately turns his back on all help from anyone else in order to taste the rotten luxury of knowing himself to be lost.
Thomas Merton
Distress tends to make you feel constricted in your personal identity, but if you are thinking of the distress of the whole of humanity, or even just the sadness of people around you in your everyday life, you begin to realize how puny your concern for yourself is.
Vilayat Khan
Hopelessness can arise, I think, only from an inability to face the present, to live in the present, to live as a responsible being among other beings in this sacred world here and now, which is all we have, and all we need to found our hope upon.
Ursula Le Guin
Depression can be a signal to reexamine assumptions and change strategies—a slowing down to reorient. If we are to deal effectively with problems, we have to see them realistically. And we have to define our purpose... The best antidepressants are expression and action—engagement in the struggle. That way depression is not an end, but a meaningful beginning.
Marilyn Ferguson
While I breathe, I hope.
Latin Proverb
Never despair but if you do, work on in despair.
Edmund Burke
Darkness is only driven out with light, not more darkness.

It is very hard to explain to people who have never known serious depression or anxiety the sheer continuous intensity of it. There is no off switch.
Matt Haig
If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present.

Depression taught me the importance of compassion and hard work, and that you can overcome enormous obstacles.
Rob Delaney
Perhaps depression is caused by asking oneself too many unanswerable questions.
Miriam Toews
It’s so difficult to describe depression to someone who’s never been there, because it’s not sadness. I know sadness. Sadness is to cry and to feel. But it’s that cold absence of feeling—that really hollowed-out feeling.
J.K. Rowling
A depressing and difficult passage has prefaced every page I have turned in life.
Charlotte Brontë
The five stages – denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance – are a part of the framework that makes up our learning to live with the one we lost. They are tools to help us frame and identify what we may be feeling. But they are not stops on some linear timeline in grief.
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross
Concern should drive us into action and not into a depression. No man is free who cannot control himself.

The opposite of play is not work – the opposite of play is depression.
Stuart Brown
All depression has its roots in self-pity, and all self-pity is rooted in people taking themselves too seriously.
Tom Robbins
This is my depressed stance. When you’re depressed, it makes a lot of difference how you stand. The worst thing you can do is straighten up and hold your head high because then you’ll start to feel better. If you’re going to get any joy out of being depressed, you’ve got to stand like this.
Charles Shultz
Noble deeds and hot baths are the best cures for depression.

Before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure that you are not, in fact, just surrounded by assholes.
William Gibson
When people don’t know exactly what depression is, they can be judgmental.
Marion Cotillard
When you’re surrounded by all these people, it can be lonelier than when you’re by yourself. You can be in a huge crowd, but if you don’t feel like you can trust anyone or talk to anybody, you feel like you’re really alone.
Fiona Apple
One swallow does not make a summer, neither does one fine day; similarly one day or brief time of happiness does not make a person entirely happy.

P.G. Wodehouse
Crying is one of the highest devotional songs. One who knows crying, knows spiritual practice. If you can cry with a pure heart, nothing else compares to such a prayer. Crying includes all the principles of Yoga.
Kripalvanandji
I didn’t want my picture taken because I was going to cry. I didn’t know why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or looked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the sobs would fly out of my throat and I’d cry for a week. I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full.

James Branch Cabell
Tonight, once more, life sinks its teeth into my heart.
Simone De Beauvoir
Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.
Oscar Wilde
Being sad and being depressed are two different things. Also, people going through depression don’t look so, while someone sad will look sad. The most common reaction is, ‘How can you be depressed? You have everything going for you.
Deepika Padukone
Recovering from the suicide of a loved one, you need all the help you can get, so I very much recommend a meditation program. The whole picture of how to recover from this has to do with body, mind, and spirit. That’s applicable to any kind of depression.
Judy Collins
The deepest fear we have, ‘the fear beneath all fears,’ is the fear of not measuring up, the fear of judgment. It’s this fear that creates the stress and depression of everyday life.
Tullian Tchividjian
There is no point treating a depressed person as though she were just feeling sad, saying, ‘There now, hang on, you’ll get over it.’ Sadness is more or less like a head cold – with patience, it passes. Depression is like cancer.
Barbara Kingsolver
I’ve got a bad case of the 3:00 am guilts – you know, when you lie in bed awake and replay all those things you didn’t do right? Because, as we all know, nothing solves insomnia like a nice warm glass of regret, depression and self-loathing.
D.D. Barant
It’s my experience that people are a lot more sympathetic if they can see you hurting, and for the millionth time in my life I wish for measles or smallpox or some other easily understood disease just to make it easier on me and also on them.
Jennifer Niven
I don’t want to see anyone. I lie in the bedroom with the curtains drawn and nothingness washing over me like a sluggish wave. Whatever is happening to me is my own fault. I have done something wrong, something so huge I can’t even see it, something that’s drowning me. I am inadequate and stupid, without worth. I might as well be dead.
Margaret Atwood
A big part of depression is feeling really lonely, even if you’re in a room full of a million people.
Lilly Singh
Depression, for me, has been a couple of different things – but the first time I felt it, I felt helpless, hopeless, and things I had never felt before. I lost myself and my will to live.
Ginger Zee
Depression is being colorblind and constantly told how colorful the world is.

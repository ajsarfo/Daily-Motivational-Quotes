Football, wherein is nothing but beastly fury, and extreme violence, whereof proceedeth hurt, and consequently rancour and malice do remain with them that be wounded.

Most football players are temperamental. That's 90 percent temper and 10 percent mental.
Doug Plank
Football is mesmerizing, because it's a figurative war. You go in one direction till you get there, but you get there as a team, not as an individual. Players bond whether they're black or white, much as soldiers do.
Oliver Stone
Football is, after all, a wonderful way to get rid of your aggressions without going to jail for it.
Heywood Hale Brown
American football makes rugby look like a Tupperware party.
Sue Lawley
The tactical difference between Association Football and Rugby with its varieties seems to be that in the former the ball is the missile, in the latter men are the missiles.
Alfred E. Crawley
Let's face it, you have to have a slightly recessive gene that has a little something to do with the brain to go out on the football field and beat your head against other human beings on a daily basis.
Tim Green
You have to play this game like somebody just hit your mother with a two-by-four.
Dan Birdwell
As concerning football, I protest unto you that it may rather be called a friendly kind of fight than a play or recreation - a bloody and murdering practise than a fellowly sport or pastime.
Philip Stubbes quotes
What's the toughest thing in a professional football game? Well, it's being the mother of the quarterback.
John Madden
Football is a game played with arms, legs and shoulders but mostly from the neck up.
Knute Rockne
To play this game (football) you must have fire in you, and there is nothing that strokes fire like hate.

In life, as in football, you won't go far unless you know where the goalposts are.
Arnold H. Glasow
At the base of it was the urge, if you wanted to play football, to knock someone down, that was what the sport was all about, the will to win closely linked with contact.
George Plimpton
College football is a sport that bears the same relation to education that bullfighting does to agriculture.
Elbert Hubbard
Football fans share a universal language that cuts across many cultures and many personality types. A serious football fan is never alone. We are legion, and football is often the only thing we have in common.
Hunter S. Thompson
The essence of football was blocking, tackling, and execution based on timing, rhythm and deception.

Football combines two of the worst things in American life. It is violence punctuated by committee meetings.
George F. Will
Football is a simple game based on the giving and taking of passes, of controlling the ball and of making yourself available to receive a pass. It is terribly simple.

Anybody who watches three games of football in a row should be declared brain dead.

Football is all very well as a game for rough girls, but is hardly suitable for delicate boys.
Oscar Wilde
Some people think football is a matter of life and death. I assure you, it's much more serious than that.
Bill Shankly
Football is the ballet of the masses.
Dmitri Shostakovich
If you have not seen it, FOOTBALL is a game in which men shove one another back and forth for no reason. They do not choose how, when, or whom they shove. They are doing this in order to please one angry old man on the sidelines. This old man is called the 'coach' or 'yelling surrogate' dad who will never be happy.

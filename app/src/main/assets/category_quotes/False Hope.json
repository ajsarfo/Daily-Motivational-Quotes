It is a healthy approach not to expect persons to turn out precisely how you would have wished.
Criss Jami
Better to know the quick pain of truth than the ongoing pain of a long-held false hope.
Trudi Canavan
And as far as false hope, there is no such thing. There is only hope or the absence of hope - nothing else.
Patti Davis
False hope really makes you cynical.
Bill Maher
It is always the false that makes you suffer, the false desires and fears, the false values and ideas, the false relationships between people. Abandon the false and you are free of pain; truth makes you happy, truth liberates.
Nisardagatta Maharaj
Hope is a word that can kill as well as save. A double-sided knife onto whose handle we all cling. If hope is our dreams, it takes courage to strive for those dreams; to not abandon hope as one of folly. A person lost can have hope of being found, but false hope, a hope that can torture a soul with promises never delivered, that is a hope we can all live without.
Paul Howsley
False hope is clung to with all one's might and main, till a day comes when it has sucked the heart dry and it forcibly breaks through its bonds and departs. After that comes the misery of awakening, and then once again, the longing to get back into the maze of the same mistakes.
Rabindranath Tagore
To keep false hopes is to prolong misery.
Amy Tan
Sugar coating things makes people feel better, but it also gives them false hope, and it keeps them holding onto the wrong people.
Sonya Parker
Because sometimes people who seem good end up being not as good as you might have hoped.
Jonathan Safran Foer
Hope itself is always genuine. It's only what it's placed in that can prove to be false.
Karen Maitland
That would be the death of anyone - to recognize false hopes with a certainty. One mustn't know that.
Jesse Ball
What is false about hope?
Mitch Albom
False hope is sometimes mistaken for true love. Don't rush into something until you're sure it actually exists.
Susan Gale
False hope is sometimes much worse and sometimes much better than no hope.
Mike Caro
If you expect nothing, you can never be disappointed.
Tonya Hurley
False hope can lead to intemperate choices and flawed decision making. True hope takes into account the real threats that exist and seeks to navigate the best path around them.
Jerome Groopman
Harsh reality is always better than false hope.
Julian Fellowes
A false hope gives only false comfort.
Gene Brewer
False hope is the bread - and - butter of my existence, the only thing that keeps me going.
Rob Payne
Hope is such a tenuous quality. To feel it and then to be denied what one most longs for. Better, surely, not to hope at all, than to open the heart to a hope that is impossible.
Juliet Marillier
There is something truly restorative, finally comforting, in coming to the end of an illusion - a false hope.
Sue Miller
False hopes are more dangerous than fears.
J. R. R. Tolkien
Expectations were like fine pottery. The harder you held them, the more likely they were to crack.
Brandon Sanderson
False hope is nicer than no hope at all.
Edgar Allan Poe
False hope is worse than despair.
Jonathan Kozol
A clear rejection is better than a fake promise.
Leonardo DiCaprio
If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway.

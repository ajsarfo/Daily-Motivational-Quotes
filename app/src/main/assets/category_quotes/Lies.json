Finley Peter Dunne
Lying increases the creative faculties, expands the ego, lessens the friction of social contacts. It is only in lies, wholeheartedly and bravely told, that human nature attains through words and speech the forbearance, the nobility, the romance, the idealism, that -- being what it is -- it falls so short of in fact and in deed.

People do not believe lies because they have to, but because they want to.
Malcolm Muggeridge
A lie never lives to be old.
Sophocles quotes
The more you defend a lie, the angrier you become.
Mitch Albom
Because everybody lies. It's part of living in society. Don't get me wrong - I think it's necessary. The last thing anyone wants is to live in a society where total honesty prevails. Can you imagine the conversations? You're short and fat, one person might say, and the other might answer, I know. But you smell bad. It just wouldn't work. So people lie by omission all the time. People will tell you most of the story...and I've learned that the part they neglect to tell you is often the most important part. People hide the truth because they're afraid.
Nicholas Sparks
A lie will easily get you out of a scrape, and yet, strangely and beautifully, rapture possesses you when you have taken the scrape and left out the lie.
C. E. Montague
Falsehood is so easy, truth so difficult....Examine your words well, and you will find that even when you have no motive to be false, it is a very hard thing to say the exact truth, even about your own immediate feelings -- much harder than to say something fine about them which is_not_the exact truth.
George Eliot
Falsehoods not only disagree with truths, but usually quarrel among themselves.
Daniel Webster
The only form of lying that is absolutely beyond reproach is Iying for its own sake.

William Butler Yeats
Truth, like light, blinds. Falsehood, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight that enhances every object.

Deception is not as creative as truth. We do best in life if we look at it with clear eyes, and I think that applies to coming up to death as well.

If you want truth to go round the world you must hire an express train to pull it; but if you want a lie to go round the world, it will fly: it is as light as a feather, and a breath will carry it. It is well said in the old proverb, ‘a lie will go round the world while truth is pulling its boots on.
C.H. Spurgeon
The cruellest lies are often told in silence.

Plato
There is no worse lie than a truth misunderstood by those who hear it.

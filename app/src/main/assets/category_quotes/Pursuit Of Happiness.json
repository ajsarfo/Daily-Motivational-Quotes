Happy times are great, but happy times pass--they have to because time passes. The pursuit of happiness is more elusive; it is life-long, and it is not goal-centered. What you are pursuing is meaning--- a meaningful life. There's the hap-- the fate, the draw that is yours, and it isn't fixed, but changing the course of the stream, or dealing new cards, whatever metaphor you want to use---that's going to take a lot of energy. There are times when it will go so wrong that you will barely be alive, and times when you realise that being barely alive, on your own terms, is better than living a bloated half-life on someone else's terms. The pursuit isn't all or nothing--- it's all AND nothing.","name" : "Jeanette Winterson"},{"message" : "As long as you are pursuing happiness, you do not have it.","name" : "Khang Kijarro Nguyen"},{"message" : "It is the pursuit of happiness that makes people unhappy","name" : "Piero Scaruffi"},{"message" : "Pursuit of happiness is a pursuit of mirage; you only realize its a delusion at the end of the road","name" : "A.M.M Alusi"},{"message" : "The pursuit of happiness is a most ridiculous phrase: if you pursue happiness you'll never find it.","name" : "Carrie Snow"},{"message" : "Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.","name" : "Guillaume Apollinaire"},{"message" : "If there is an abiding theme in 'The Pursuit of Happiness,' it is the idea that you come into the world already shaped by other people's past histories.","name" : "Douglas Kennedy"},{"message" : "If you want happiness for an hour – take a nap.

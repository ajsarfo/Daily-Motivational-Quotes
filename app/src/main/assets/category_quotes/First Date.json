I spent the weekend after our date wishing I could stab him with my fluffy duck pen and staring at the phone hoping he'd call. Dating is a very tricky business.
Cath Crowley
Men don't realize that if we're sleeping with them on the first date, we’re probably not interested in seeing them again either.
Chelsea Handler
I was on a date with this really hot model. Well, it wasn't really a date date. We just ate dinner and saw a movie. Then the plane landed.
Dave Attell
I'm always looking for meaningful one night stands.
Dudley Moore
At first I thought he was walking the dog and then I realized it was his date.
Edith Massey
This is one rule about mixing boys and girls: that a date always comes first.
Elizabeth Berg
Memory has always fascinated me. Think of it. You can recall at will your first day in high school, your first date, your first love.
Eric Kandel
I'm dating a woman now who, evidently, is unaware of it.
Garry Shandling
The worst thing a man can ever do is kiss me on the first date.
Halle Berry
Dating is about finding out who you are and who others are. If you show up in a masquerade outfit, neither is going to happen.
Henry Cloud
Dating is a give and take. If you only see it as ‘taking,’ you are not getting it.
Henry Cloud
The cry of the soul is for freedom. It longs for liberty, from the date of its first conscious moments.
J. G. Holland
For our first date we went Dutch. We would have gone another nationality, but they are the tallest.
Jarod Kintz
If you kiss on the first date and it's not right, then there will be no second date. Sometimes it's better to hold out and not kiss for a long time. I am a strong believer in kissing being very intimate, and the minute you kiss, the floodgates open for everything else.
Jennifer Lopez
Dating is pressure and tension.
Jerry Seinfeld
What is a date, really, but a job interview that lasts all night? The only difference is there aren't many job interviews where you'll wind up naked.
Jerry Seinfeld
The joy of intimacy is the reward of commitment.
Joshua Harris
Yeah, well, not many boys take their girls out on a duck shoot with them as the target for a first date. You have to give me points for style.
Joss Stirling
I'd like to start a family, but you have to have a date first.
Larry David
I don't kiss on the first date. My friends always make fun of me for that! But I will hold hands.
Lauren Conrad
It’s always been my personal feeling that unless you are married, there is something that is not very dignified about talking about who you are dating.
Luke Wilson
Better to put your heart on the line, risk everything, and walk away with nothing than play it safe. Love is a lot of things, but safe isn't one of them.
Mandy Hale
Good looking individuals are treated better than homely ones in virtually every social situation, from dating to trial by jury.
Martha Beck
Dating is where you pretend you're someone you're not to impress someone you don't know.
Melanie White
As for me, I was already in love and ready to get engaged, which we did three and a half weeks after we met. Four months later we got married.
Michael W. Smith
A man on a date wonders if he'll get lucky. The woman already knows.
Monica Piper
It is the same way with dating. The time you are most prepared for dating is when you don't need anyone to complete you, fulfill you, or instill in you a sense of worth or purpose. You are ready to date when you have first learned how to be single.
Myles Munroe
A person’s readiness to date is largely a matter of maturity and environment.
Myles Munroe
If you think there are no new frontiers, watch a boy ring the front doorbell on his first date.
Olin Miller
She realized she'd never felt this happy, even at her old school, she had been an outsider, always the lonely girl, the one who stayed at home watching tv on Saturday nights while her friends went to parties and out on dates.
R.L. Stine
I tell ya, my wife was never nice to me.
Rodney Dangerfield
A guy should make the woman he is dating feel different and more special than anyone else in his life.
Samantha Daniels
Love is so unpredictable. Sometimes you'll know a man for years and then one day, boom! Suddenly you see him in a different way. And other times, it's that first date, that first moment. That's what makes it so great.
Sarah Dessen
I went on a date recently and the guy took me horseback riding. That was kind of fun, until we ran out of quarters.
Susie Loucks
A first date should be elegant. In comfortable surroundings. A place with excellent food, where you can talk easily and get to know each other.
Oleg Cassini
I shake hands on the first date.
Nargis Fakhri
Beware the man who doesn't ask you any questions about yourself on your first date.
Merrill Markoe
The perfect date is the one where anything and everything goes wrong, but at the end of it, all you want is to see them again.

We always blame the woman when a man falls in love, as though no man had the courage of his inclinations.
Samuel Taylor
Morality is what the queen expects from the hive, not from herself.
Marty Rubin
It is forbidden to kill; therefore all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets.
Voltaire
When I kiss a girl for a part, people think it's sexy. But if two guys kiss, suddenly there's a backlash. It's a double standard.
Olivia Wilde
People cant handle the truth unless you speak to them with a mirror.
Lakia Echols
Leaders scan the future so it can be free of doubts and fear. They do so by not living a double standard life in the present.

In relation to a writer, most readers believe in the Double Standard: they may be unfaithful to him as often as they like, but he must never, never be unfaithful to them.
W. H. Auden
We have a double standard, which is to say, a man can show how much he cares by being violent see, he's jealous, he cares a woman shows how much she cares by how much she's willing to be hurt; by how much she will take; how much she will endure; how suicidal she's prepared to be.
Andrea Dworkin
I think we cannot have a double standard. We cannot see our art as different from the reality. We cannot use two different sets of judgment.
Ai Weiwei
There's a double standard between writers and readers. Readers can be unfaithful to writers anytime they like, but writers must never ever be unfaithful to the readers.
Peter Schjeldahl
A politician is a man who will double cross that bridge when he comes to it.
Oscar Levant
The double standard of morality will survive in this world so long as the woman whose husband has been lured away is favoured with the sympathetic tears of other women, and a man whose wife has made off is laughed at by other men.
H. L. Mencken
We cannot use a double standard for measuring our own and other people's policies. Our demands for democratic practices in other lands will be no more effective than the guarantees of those practiced in our own country.
Hubert H. Humphrey
It's a double standard. They say these management guys are so valuable. They are not. This is typical corporate greed.
Bobby De Pace
It's true that in Cuba there are double standards, there's opportunism, and there is a lack of freedom in some ways.
Fernando Perez
Apparently when it's two people, it's quirky and funny, but when it's a person doing the same stuff on her own, it's rebellious and antisocial.
Katie Alender
I will not calm down! Women are allowed to get angrier than men about double standards.
Liz
Once you've lived the inside-out world of espionage, you never shed it. It's a mentality, a double standard of existence.
John Le Carre
There's definitely a whole double standard. I don't understand it. A guy can be sexy and good looking, and it totally just enhances his credibility as an athlete.
Lolo Jones
There's been a decline in the double standard. That's why you're seeing more of these cases.
David Finkelhor
It is vain to expect virtue from women till they are in some degree independent of men.
Mary Wollstonecraft
I think there will always be a double standard between males and females, so I think that an actress is more likely to protect her public persona, so to speak, than an actor would be.
Mila Kunis
It's very clear that there's a lot of double standards going on. Should there be a 30mph speed limit? Of course there bloody should. And certainly with kids and school food, kids need to be nannied for sure. So give them a bloody good meal at school.
Jamie Oliver
There is this double standard. The losses are larger in other areas of the tax code, but somehow a different standard gets applied to this.
Robert Greenstein
I hate to hear you talk about all women as if they were fine ladies instead of rational creatures. None of us want to be in calm waters all our lives.
Jane Austen
History is filled with double standards: a man who uses a woman is colored an ass, yet a woman who uses a man is hailed as resourceful.
Ken Poirot
Let's not have a double standard. One standard will do just fine.
George Carlin
There is a double-standard. And quite often if you're from Africa, if you're from a developing country, you'll be executed. There aren't that many people protesting or making a big fuss.

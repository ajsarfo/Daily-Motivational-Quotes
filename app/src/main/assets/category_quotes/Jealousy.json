Jealousy scans for evidence to prove the point - that others will be preferred and rewarded more than you. There is only one alternative - self-value. If you cannot love yourself, you will not believe that you are loved. You will always think it's a mistake or luck. Take your eyes off others and turn the scanner within. Find the seeds of your jealousy, clear the old voices and experiences. Put all the energy into building your personal and emotional security. Then you will be the one others envy, and you can remember the pain and reach out to them.","name" : "Jennifer James"},{"message" : "Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of an omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold of the heart.","name" : "George Eliot"},{"message" : "Jealousy is that pain which a man feels from the apprehension that he is not equally beloved by the person whom he entirely loves.","name" : "Joseph Addison"},{"message" : "Jealousy would be far less torturous if we understood that love is a passion entirely unrelated to our merits.","name" : "Paul Eldridge"},{"message" : "Jealousy is not a barometer by which the depth of love can be read, it merely records the degree of the lover's insecurity.","name" : "Margaret Mead"},{"message" : "Jealousy is one of the wickedest of all the passions.

This civil dissension in the mind, like that of the body politic, commits great disorders, and lays all waste. Nothing stands safe in its way; Nature, interest, religion, must yield to its fury. It violates contracts, dissolves society, breaks wedlock, betrays friends and neighbours. No body is good, and every one is either doing or designing them a mischief.

Geeks can be found in all walks of life, from politics to sports, and yes, technology,too.

Are you curious about how the world works and enjoy figuring out why something ticks? If so, you're probably a geek, the type of person who would rather be handed a box of tools, kitchen stuff, or bicycle parts and be let loose to play than be told what to do.

Sometimes, thinking like a geek means being inventive in how you solve a problem— coming up with a clever trick to get around something that's broken or just seeing easier ways to do something.

Challenging a geek to deconstruct a problem rationally is like putting peanut butter in front of a chipmunk— they almost can't help themselves.

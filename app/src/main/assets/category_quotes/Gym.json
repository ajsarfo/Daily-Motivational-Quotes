Elaine Moran
The real workout starts when you want to stop.
Ronnie Coleman
If you think lifting weights is dangerous, try being weak. Being weak is dangerous.

Jim Wendler
The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination.
Tommy Lasorda

Nan Marshall
If it weren't for the fact that the TV set and the refrigerator are so far apart, some of us wouldn't get any exercise at all.
Joey Adams
I have to exercise in the morning, before my brain figures out what I'm doing.
Marsha Doble
An hour of basketball feels like 15 minutes. An hour of treadmill feels like a weekend in traffic school.
David Walters
A man who drinks in a healthy, fit, and self-approving manner will mix vodka with yogurt and get tangled in the Nautilus machine trying to kiss his own ass.

People come to the gym to enhance their looks and health or simply to enjoy the activity and improve their quality of life.
Yigal Pinchas
The gym is a protected artificial environment that can be accessible to all exercises at all times and under all conditions.
Yigal Pinchas
The gym is also the ideal place for those 'loners' who come to work out rather than to develop social ties.

Now that I am in the gym, though interestingly I still choose the group exercise studio within the gym, I am there so frequently that it has become almost a second home to me.

At the end of each of those hectic days as I do on most workdays, I would eagerly look forward to lifting weights or do aerobics with my woman friends at the gym.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
In gym class, learning involves both your brain and your body. It teaches your body how to move.
Darlene R. Stille
What hurts today makes you stronger tomorrow.

Michelle Obama
The word 'aerobics' came about when the gym instructors got together and said: If we're going to charge $10 an hour, we can't call it Jumping up and down.
Rita Rudner
You're going to have to let it hurt. Let it suck. The harder you work, the better you will look. Your appearance isn’t parallel to how heavy you lift, it’s parallel to how hard you work.
Joe Manganiello
The gym is somewhere you can go to just forget for an hour what you do for a living, what you are doing on a daily basis. You just turn up and get on with it.

Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.
Mahatma Gandhi
It’s going to be a journey. It’s not a sprint to get in shape.
Kerri Walsh Jennings
Going to the gym was never about 'working out' like it is for most people. To me, It was a matter of life or death. It was either me or the weights-and I was going to win. I've always had that competitive streak, whether it was in the gym, on the stage, or In anything else I did.
Rich Gaspari
When people tell me they can't afford to join a gym, I tell them to go outside; planet Earth is a gym and we're already members. Run, climb, sweat, and enjoy all of the natural wonders that are available to you.
Steve Maraboli
Your mind is the strongest and most valuable muscle you can grow in the gym.
Greg Plitt
When it comes to eating right and exercising, there is no ‘I'll start tomorrow.’ Tomorrow is a disease.

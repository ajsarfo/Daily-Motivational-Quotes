Pure mathematics is on the whole distinctly more useful than applied. For what is useful above all is technique, and mathematical technique is taught mainly through pure mathematics.
G. H. Hardy
Mathematics is as much an aspect of culture as it is a collection of algorithms.
Carl Boyer
Mathematics is a game played according to certain simple rules with meaningless marks on paper.
David Hilbert
You can not apply mathematics as long as words still becloud reality.
Hermann Weyl
Mathematics is the tool specially suited for dealing with abstract concepts of any kind and there is no limit to its power in this field.
P. Dirac.
The power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.
Marcus Du Sautoy
Mathematics is the gate and key to science.
Roger Bacon
God used beautiful mathematics in creating the world.
Paul Dirac
Mathematics is a game played according to certain rules with meaningless marks on paper.
David Hilbert
Mathematics is written for mathematicians.
Nicolaus Copernicus
The science of pure mathematics, in its modern developments, may claim to be the most original creation of the human spirit.
Alfred North Whitehead
The most painful thing about mathematics is how far away you are from being able to use it after you have learned it.
James Newman
Mathematics is concerned only with the enumeration and comparison of relations.
Carl Friedrich Gauss
Mathematics cannot handle physical quantities like density that literally go to infinity.
Gregory Benford
The art of doing mathematics consists in finding that special case which contains all the germs of generality.
David Hilbert
Mathematics allows for no hypocrisy and no vagueness.
Stendhal
Mathematics is as old as Man.
Stefan Banach
Thus, in a sense, mathematics has been most advanced by those who distinguished themselves by intuition rather than by rigorous proofs.
Felix Klein
What is best in mathematics deserves not merely to be learned as a task but to be assimilated as a part of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind with ever-renewed encouragement.
Bertrand Russell
Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty.
Bertrand Russell
For the things of this world cannot be made known without a knowledge of mathematics.
Roger Bacon
You do not study mathematics because it helps you build a bridge. You study mathematics because it is the poetry of the universe. Its beauty transcends mere things.
Johnathan David Farley
Mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.
Bertrand Russell
Mathematics is a place where you can do things which you can't do in the real world.
Marcus Du Sautoy
Without mathematics, there's nothing you can do. Everything around you is mathematics. Everything around you is numbers.
Shakuntala Devi
Mathematics takes us into the region of absolute necessity, to which not only the actual word, but every possible word, must conform.
Bertrand Russell
Mathematics has beauty and romance. It's not a boring place to be, the mathematical world. It's an extraordinary place; it's worth spending time there.
Marcus Du Sautoy
Logic and mathematics are nothing but specialised linguistic structures.
Jean Piaget
One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application, because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns, and that's what we love, and that's what we get off on.
Danica Mckellar
Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.
Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel
All mathematics is is a language that is well tuned, finely honed, to describe patterns; be it patterns in a star, which has five points that are regularly arranged, be it patterns in numbers like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 that follow very regular progression.
Brian Greene
The abstract analysis of the world by mathematics and physics rests on the concepts of space and time.
James J. Gibson
If a man's wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics.
Francis Bacon
Mathematics is the language with which God wrote the universe.
Galileo
Mathematics is the music of reason.
James Joseph Sylvester
Mathematics knows no races or geographic boundaries; for mathematics, the cultural world is one country.
David Hilbert
A lot of music is mathematics. It's balance.
Mel Brooks
Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.
Henri Poincare
In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.
Georg Cantor
Mathematics consists in proving the most obvious thing in the least obvious way.
George Polya
The longer mathematics lives the more abstract - and therefore, possibly also the more practical - it becomes.
E. T. Bell
The essence of mathematics lies in its freedom.
Georg Cantor
Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.
Albert Einstein
Mathematics is the most beautiful and most powerful creation of the human spirit.
Stefan Banach
The study of mathematics, like the Nile, begins in minuteness but ends in magnificence.
Charles Caleb Colton
Mathematics is the queen of science.
Carl Friedrich Gauss
Well, some mathematics problems look simple, and you try them for a year or so, and then you try them for a hundred years, and it turns out that they're extremely hard to solve.
Andrew Wiles
But mathematics is the sister, as well as the servant, of the arts and is touched by the same madness and genius.
Marston Morse

Going through puberty as a young girl is so confusing. This monster invades your body changes things and makes things grow and no one tells you what's going on.
Katharine Isabelle
Adolescence is a new birth, for the higher and more completely human traits are now born.

Anais Nin

G. Stanley Hall

Adolescence represents an inner emotional upheaval, a struggle between the eternal human wish to cling to the past and the equally powerful wish to get on with the future.
Louise J. Kaplan
Adolescence has been recognised as a stage of human development since medieval times long, long before the industrial revolution and, as it is now, has long been seen as a phase which centers on the fusion of sexual and social maturity. Indeed, adolescence as a concept has as long a history as that of puberty, which is sometimes considered more concrete, and hence much easier to name and to recognize.

Adolescence is just one big walking pimple.
Carol Burnett
Adolescence is perhaps nature's way of preparing parents to welcome the empty nest.
Karen Savage

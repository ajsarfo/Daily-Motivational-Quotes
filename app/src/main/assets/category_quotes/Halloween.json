Halloween wraps fear in innocence, as though it were a lightly sour sweet. Let terror, then, be turned into a treat...
Nick Gordon
As spirits roam the neighborhoods at night, let loose upon the Earth till it be light...
Nicholas Gordon
I don't know that there are real ghosts and goblins, but there are always more trick-or-treaters than neighborhood kids.

Halloween wraps fear in innocence, As though it were a slightly sour sweet. Let terror, then, be turned into a treat.

Pixie, kobold, elf, and sprite, All are on their rounds tonight; In the wan moon's silver ray, Thrives their helter-skelter play.

A house is never still in darkness to those who listen intently; there is a whispering in distant chambers, an unearthly hand presses the snib of the window, the latch rises. Ghosts were created when the first man awoke in the night.
James Matthew Barrie
Eye of newt, and toe of frog, Wool of bat, and tongue of dog, Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting, Lizard's leg, and owlet's wing, For a charm of powerful trouble, Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
William Shakespeare
Oh how the candles will be lit and the wood of worm burn in a fiery dust. For on all Hallow's Eve will the spirits come to play, and only the fruit of thy womb will satisfy their endless roaming.

The witches fly across the sky, The owls go, Who? Who? Who? The black cats yowl And green ghosts howl, Scary Halloween to you!

Nothing on Earth so beautiful as the final haul on Halloween night.

I try to remember, as I hear about friends getting engaged, that it's not about the ring and it's not about the wedding. It's a grave thing, getting married. And it's easy to get swept up in the wrong things.

You rose into my life like a promised sunrise, brightening my days with the light in your eyes. I've never been so strong. Now I'm where I belong.
Maya Angelou
We start a relationship with someone not only because of how great they are but how great they make us feel. And because they have granted us this extraordinary giftâ€”a chance to experience love, joy, compassion, and security â€”it is our exclusive privilege to make them feel wonderful about themselves, especially during days when they, themselves, don't feel so wonderful.
Kamand Kojouri
Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.
Emily Bronte
If you want to sacrifice the admiration of many men for the criticism of one, go ahead, get married.
Katharine Hepburn
We're all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness - and call it love - true love.
Robert Fulghum
The Oriole weds his mottled mate, the Lily weds the bee; Heaven's marriage ring is round the earth, let me bind thee?

I couldn't have dreamed you into existence because I didn't even know I needed you. You must have been sent to me.
Kamand Kojouri
It is the duty of the bride's father to give a party to announce the engagement. Apparently this is done only after everyone knows about it.
Spencer Tracy
An engagement should come upon a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant as the case may be. It is hardly a matter she could be allowed to arrange for herself.
Edith Evans
No engagement is worth anything unless it has been broken at least once.
Dorothy Tutin
The disgusting way an engagement is regarded public property; all these older women smirking...but my point is their whole attitude is wrong— an engagement, horrid word in the first place, is a private affair and should be regarded as such.
Daniel Day-Lewis
An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her cares are over, and she feels that may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion. All is safe with a lady engaged; no harm can be done.
Jane Austen
I would rather not be engaged. When people are engaged, they begin to thin of being married soon...and I should like everything to go on for a long while just as it is.
George Eliot
To speak frankly, I'm not in favor of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.
Oscar Wilde
Courtship to marriage is a very witty prologue to a very dull play.
William Congreve
Today, engagement parties still allow both families to meet each other if they haven't done so before. Even if both sets of parents have met, it's nice for siblings and other extended relatives to meet and mingle so they are all acquainted with one another before the wedding.
Gabrielle Kaplan-Mayer
It's never out of style to have good manners. If possible, make the engagement announcement to the bride's parents in person.
Joyce Scardina-Becker
Although somewhat outdated, the use of formal announcement cards is a beautiful and elegant way to spread the word of your engagement.
Joyce Scardina-Becker
And how my anguish, when she drew her glove, .And showed the plain gold sign of wedded love, . Refused assuagement:— . Why is it that I do not care a jot . If this one wears such fateful ring, or not— .
James Brunton-Stephen
Herbert broke our engagement of eight years . When Annabelle returned to the village . From the Seminary, ah me! . If I had let my love for him alone . It might have grown into a beautiful sorrow.
Edgar Lee Masters
The best thing that the diamond ring could do; was to amicably occupy a place on the engagement finger,
Nikhil Parekh
If we don't break this off, there will be time enough . For that sort of thing; but the bargain must be, . That as long as I choose I am perfectly free: . For this is a sort of engagement, you see, . Which is binding on you, but not binding on me.
William Allen Butler
Once I was a King . Now I'm wrapped around her finger . Like a diamond ring . The engagement ring . The wedding ring . The church bells ring . And the suffering.
Stuart Phillips
Darling me and you, we had a strange arrangement . But you broke all the rules . And I'm through playing the fool for love . Darling yes it's true, we had a grand engagement . But I can't stand by, while you break my heart in two . Ooh, I've got to be a man . Baby I've got to take a stand, so.
Andrew M. Cohen
Many people spend more time in planning the wedding than they do in planning the marriage.

And I'd choose you; in a hundred lifetimes, in a hundred worlds, in any version of reality, I'd find you and I'd choose you.

It is sometimes essential for a husband and a wife to quarrel—they get to know each other better.
Johann Wolfang Von Goethe
What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life – to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories.

Before you marry a person, you should first make them use a computer with slow Internet to see who they really are.

It's so great to find that one special person you want to annoy for the rest of your life.
Rita Rudner
Success in marriage does not come merely through finding the right mate, but through being the right mate.

Engagement can be a commitment to love or a declaration of war. One must enter every battle without hesitation, willing to fully engage the enemy until death do you apart.
Emily Thorne
A perfect couple shares their failures, mistakes and their successes equally and deal with them all as a team.
Ricardo Derose

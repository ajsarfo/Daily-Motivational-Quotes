Reconciliation always brings a springtime to the soul.
Brother Roger
Then you must reconcile yourself to the fact that something is always hurt by any change. If you do this, you will not be hurt yourself.
Roger Zelazny
Reconciliation is a decision that you take in your heart.
Ingrid Betancourt
Reconciliation should be accompanied by justice, otherwise it will not last. While we all hope for peace it shouldn't be peace at any cost but peace based on principle, on justice.
Corazon Aquino
Moving beyond past wounds and hurts and building a culture of respect, dignity, and flowering love.
William Keepin
There is always a way forward if the responsible parties are willing to act.
Auliq-Ice
Reconciliation with our enemies is simply a desire to better our condition, a weariness of war, or the fear of some unlucky thing from occurring.
Francois de la Rochefoucauld
If there is to be reconciliation, first there must be truth.
Timothy B. Tyson
No matter what the hatred is, preserve the possibility of peace and always have room for forgiveness.
Auliq-Ice
In life, we make the best decisions we can with the information we have on hand.
Agnes Kamara-umunna
True reconciliation does not consist in merely forgetting the past.
Nelson Mandela
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
Matthew 18:15
Reconciliation is more beautiful than victory.
Violeta Chamorro
Reconciliation is a part of the healing process, but how can there be healing when the wounds are still being inflicted?
N. K. Jemisin
Reconciliation is the physical demonstration that God is at work in the world. Any fool can put people at odds. Only God â€“ one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all â€“ can bring those opposed to one another together as sisters and brother. When we lose reconciliation, we lose the purposes of Jesus.
Sean Palmer
The only way to overcome the griefâ€¬ is to go through it!
Paul Gitwaza
It is much safer to reconcile an enemy than to conquer him; victory may deprive him of his poison, but reconciliation of his will.
Feltham
Contradictions are the impossible chasms that create forever separations. God is the forever bridge that creates impossible reunions.
Craig D. Lounsbrough
Emphasize reconciliation, not resolution. It is unrealistic to expect everyone to agree about everything. Reconciliation focuses on the relationship, while resolution focuses on the problem. When we focus on reconciliation, the problem loses significance and often becomes irrelevant.
Rick Warren
Forget, forgive; conclude, and be agreed.
Shakespeare
One minute of reconciliation is worth more than a whole life of friendship!
Gabriel Garcia Marquez
The worst reconciliation is better than the best divorce.
Miguel de Cervantes
Reconciliation is a deep practice that we can do with our listening and our mindful speech. To reconcile means to bring peace and happiness to nations, people, and members of our family... In order to reconcile, you have to possess the art of deep listening.
Nhat Hanh
Reconciliation and forgiveness are matters of the heart. They cannot be forced on the people.
Graeme Leung
Reconciliationâ€¬ is the most significant level of life's maturity!
Paul Gitwaza
To celebrate the sacrament of reconciliation means to be wrapped in a warm embrace.
Pope Francis
Reconciliation means working together to correct the legacy of past injustice.
Nelson Mandela
Reconciliation is to understand both sides; to go to one side and describe the suffering being endured by the other side, and then go to the other side and describe the suffering being endured by the first side.
Nhat Hanh
There is no reconciliation until you recognize the dignity of the other, until you see their view- you have to enter into the pain of the people. You've got to feel their need.
John M. Perkins
It is not 'forgive and forget' as if nothing wrong had ever happened, but 'forgive and go forward,' building on the mistakes of the past and the energy generated by reconciliation to create a new future.
Alan Paton
Truth can be told in an instant, forgiveness can be offered spontaneously, but reconciliation is the work of lifetimes and generations.
Krista Tippett
Reconciliation is not possible when one party asks the other to obliterate all signs of their relationship.
Mallory Ortberg
To be a finite being is no crime, and to be the Infinite is not to be a creditor. As man was not consulted he does not find himself a party in a bargain, but a child in the household of love. Reconciliation, therefore, is not the consequence of paying a debt, or procuring atonement for an injury, but an organic process of the human life.
John Weiss
If the sun never set, we would have no perception of the vast depths of space, which become visible only at night when we are able to see what is obscured by the bright daylight.
William Keepin
Reconciliation is the fastest way to change your life.
Mark Hart
Oh, my dear friends,â€”you who are letting miserable misunderstandings run on from year to year, meaning to clear them up some day,â€”if you only could know and see and feel that the time is short, how it would break the spell! How you would go instantly and do the thing which you might never have another chance to do!
Phillips Brooks
With all the differences and misunderstandings, meeting halfway is the only way to show that both of you are willing to sacrifice a portion of yourself for the benefit of both.
NerD_Seyer
The overall purpose of human communication is - or should be - reconciliation. It should ultimately serve to lower or remove the walls of misunderstanding which unduly separate us human beings, one from another.
M. Scott Peck
The process of reclaiming the self is one of reconciliation with meaning.
Tariq Ramadan
Reconciliation is a deep practice that we can do with our listening and our mindful speech. To reconcile means to bring peace and happiness to nations, people, and members of our family.... In order to reconcile, you have to possess the art of deep listening.
Nhat Hanh
Reconciliation requires changes of heart and spirit, as well as social and economic change. It requires symbolic as well as practical action.
Malcolm Fraser
True reconciliation is never cheap, for it is based on forgiveness which is costly. Forgiveness in turn depends on repentance, which has to be based on an acknowledgment of what was done wrong, and therefore on disclosure of the truth. You cannot forgive what you do not know.
Desmond Tutu
In the end, reconciliation is a spiritual process, which requires more than just a legal framework. It has to happen in the hearts and minds of people.
Nelson Mandela

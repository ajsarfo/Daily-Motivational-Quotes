The best relationship is when you two can act like lovers and best friends at the same time. It's when you have more playful moments than serious moments. It's when you can joke around, have unexpected hugs, and random stolen kisses. It's when you two give each other that specific stare and just smile. It's when you'll rather chill inside to watch movies, eat junk food, and cuddle than go out all the time. It's when you'll stay up all night just to settle your arguments and problems. It's when you can completely act yourself and they can still love you for who you are.

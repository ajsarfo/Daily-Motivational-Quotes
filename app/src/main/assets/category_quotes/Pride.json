Once you reach the top, take care as the only way left to go is down.
Darren Bateman
One man may be more cunning than another, but not more cunning than everybody else.
Benjamin Franklin
Pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a great deal more saucy. When you have bought one fine thing, you must buy ten more, that your appearance may be all of a piece; but it is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it.
Benjamin Franklin
The devil wipes his breech with poor folks' pride.
Benjamin Franklin
The higher you climb, the heavier you fall.

A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you
C.S. Lewis
Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man... It is the comparison that makes you proud: the pleasure of being above the rest. Once the element of competition is gone, pride is gone.
C.S. Lewis
We are rarely proud when we are alone.
Voltaire
The proud person always wants to do the right thing, the great thing. But because he wants to do it in his own strength, he is fighting not with man, but with God.
Soren Kierkegaard
Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.
Emily Bronte
God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
Holy Bible, James 4:6

Carl Jung
Never look down on anybody unless you are helping them up.
Jesse Jackson
Most of the trouble in the world is caused by people wanting to be important.

Andrew Murray

Julian Barnes,Flaubert's Parrot
The proud wish God would agree with them. They are not interested in changing their opinions to agree with God's.
Ezra Taft Benson
Pride is the mother of arrogance.
Toba Beta
He who imagines he can do without the world deceives himself much; but he who fancies the world cannot do without him is still more mistaken.
Francois de la Rochefoucauld
Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man.
C.S. Lewis quotes
It is more often from 'pride' than from ignorance that we are so obstinately opposed to current opinions; we find the first places taken, and we do not want to be the last.
Franois de la Rochefoucauld
There is nothing that will kill a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with but himself.
George Eliot
To know a man, observe how he wins his object, rather than how he loses it; for when we fail our pride supports us; when we succeed, it betrays us.
Charles Caleb Coltoz
Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.
Bible
Pride sullies the noblest character.
Claudianus
In pride, in reasoning pride, our error lies; All quit their sphere and rush into the skies. Pride still is aiming at the bless'd abodes, Men would be angels, angels would be gods.
Alexander Pope
Pride is an admission of weakness; it secretly fears all competition and dreads all rivals.
Fulton J. Sheen
The infinitely little have a pride infinitely great.
Voltaire
Friends, show me a man who hates himself, and I'll show you a man who hates his neighbors more! He'd have to--you'd not grant anyone else something you can't have for yourself--no love, no kindness, no respect!
Mary Ann Shaffer
There are two kinds of pride, both good and bad. 'Good pride' represents our dignity and self-respect. 'Bad pride' is the deadly sin of superiority that reeks of conceit and arrogance.
John C. Maxwell
Pride is an independent, me-oriented spirit. It makes people arrogant, rude and hard to get along with. When our heart is prideful, we don't give God the credit and we mistreat people, looking down on them and thinking we deserve what we have.
Joyce Meyer
When you are full of pride on the inside, it makes you stiff, stubborn, and creates strife with others.
John C. Maxwell
I have come to the conclusion that it's a waste of time to have too much pride in anything. Perhaps it's good to have a sense of duty, a jealous zeal to protect or improve, but pride ultimately is only that which stands vulnerable to offense and degradation.
Henry Rollins
Pride adversely affects all our relationships - our relationship with God and His servants, between husband and wife, parent and child, employer and employee, teacher and student, and all mankind.
Ezra Taft Benson
He that is proud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours the deed in the praise.
William Shakespeare
A man's pride can be his downfall, and he needs to learn when to turn to others for support and guidance.
Bear Grylls
Pride slays thanksgiving, but a humble mind is the soil out of which thanks naturally grow. A proud man is seldom a grateful man, for he never thinks he gets as much as he deserves.
Henry Ward Beecher
Pride deafens us to the advice or warnings of those around us.
John C. Maxwell
Leaders who fail to prune their pride will meet demise. That's not a guess, it's a guarantee. With pride, it's not a matter of 'if' we will fall, but 'when.' There are no exceptions.
John C. Maxwell
Pride is the chalice into which all human sins are poured: it glitters and jingles and its arabesque lures your gaze, while your lips involuntarily touch the seductive beverage.
Vladimir Odoevsky
Pride must be a summer thing, because it comes before the fall.
Jarod Kintz
One's self-satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very unpleasant to find deprecated.
George Eliot
Your ego decides the humanity in you - higher the ego lesser the humanity....
Adil Adam Memon
In wickedness of pride is lost the light to understand how little grace is earned and how much given.
Robert Hunter
As long as you set yourself up as a little god to which you must be loyal there will be those who will delight to offer affront to your idol.
A.W. Tozer
Essentially, pride is a 'my will' rather than 'thy will' approach to life.
Ezra Taft Benson
When the serpent breathed the poison of his pride, the desire to be as God, into the hearts of our first parents, that they too fell from their high estate into all the wretchedness in which man is now sunk. In heaven and earth, pride, self-exaltation, is the gate and the birth, and the curse, of hell.
Andrew Murray
You can have pride in what you do each day, but not arrogance in what you were born with.

We ought to be ashamed of our pride, but never proud of our shame.

Charles Ofori Akrofi

Criss Jami
Pride and power fall when the person falls, but discoveries of truth form legacies that can be built upon for generations.
Criss Jami
I have had more trouble with myself than with any other man.
D.L. Moody
When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of emotion, but with creatures bristling with prejudice and motivated by pride and vanity.

Fred Allen
It's a fine thing to rise above pride, but you must have pride in order to do so
Georges Bernanos
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity, to what we would have others think of us.
Jane Austen
I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.
Jane Austen
Where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.
Jane Austen
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Jane Austen
Pride is a devastating sin and is complex. Most sins turn us away from God, but pride directly attacks God. It lifts us above and against God, seeking to dethrone Him by enthroning ourselves.
Joel Beeke
It is better to lose your pride with someone you love rather than to lose that someone you love with your useless pride.
John Ruskin

Michael Bassey Johnson
A person is wise if he listens to millions of advice and doesn't implement any of it.
Michael Bassey Johnson
I do not care so much what I am to others as I care what I am to myself.
Michel de Montaigne
Whatever makes us feel superior to other people, whatever tempts us to convey a sense of superiority, that is the gravity of our sinful nature, not grace.
Philip Yancey

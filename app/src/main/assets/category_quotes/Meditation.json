Bhagavad Gita
Meditation gives us peace of mind without a tranquilizer. And unlike a tranquilizer, the peace of mind that we get from meditation does not fade away. It lasts for good in some corner of the inmost recesses of our aspiring heart.
Sri Chinmoy
Meditation is a death - death of all that you are now. Of course there will be a resurrection, but that will be a totally new, fresh original being which you are not even aware is hidden in you.
Osho
In meditation, once you are gone in, you are gone in. Then, even when you resurrect you are a totally different person. The old personality is nowhere to be found. You have to start your life again from abc. You have to learn everything with fresh eyes, with a totally new heart. That's why meditation creates fear.
Osho
Meditation is enough. Everything else follows on its own.
Osho

Meditation is not a way of making your mind quiet. It is a way of entering into the quiet that is already there buried under the 50,000 thoughts the average person thinks every day.
Deepak Chopra
Meditate, Visualize and Create your own reality and the universe will simply reflect back to you.
Amit Ray
Meditation practice isn't about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better, it's about befriending who we are.

Daniel Kahneman
Making good decisions is a crucial skill at every level.

David Ault
Think a hundred times before you take a decision, but once that decision is taken, stand by it as one man.

George W. Cecil
Sometimes success isn't about making the right decision, it's more about making some decision.
Robin S. Sharma
If you obsess over whether you are making the right decision, you are basically assuming that the universe will reward you for one thing and punish you for another. The universe has no fixed agenda. Once you make any decision, it works around that decision. There is no right or wrong, only a series of possibilities that shift with each thought, feeling, and action that you experience. If this sounds too mystical, refer again to the body. Every significant vital sign—body temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, hormone level, brain activity, and so on—alters the moment you decide to do anything… decisions are signals telling your body, mind, and environment to move in a certain direction.
Deepak Chopra
On an important decision one rarely has 100% of the information needed for a good decision no matter how much one spends or how long one waits. And, if one waits too long, he has a different problem and has to start all over. This is the terrible dilemma of the hesitant decision maker.
Robert K. Greenleaf

Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen.
Ralph Waldo Emerson

Brian Tracy
Decision is a risk rooted in the courage of being free.

Albert Camus
A PSYCHOLOGICAL TIP: Whenever you're called on to make up your mind, . and you're hampered by not having any, . the best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find, . is simply by spinning a penny. . No — not so that chance shall decide the affair . while you're passively standing there moping; . but the moment the penny is up in the air, . you suddenly know what you're hoping.
Piet Hein
You can try to make the right decision all the time, but it's better to just make a decision. I have done wrong so many times, but nine times out of 10, I have learned from my failure. Don't wait for something; just go for it.
Bobby Bones
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You’re on your own. And you know what you know. You are the guy who’ll decide where to go.

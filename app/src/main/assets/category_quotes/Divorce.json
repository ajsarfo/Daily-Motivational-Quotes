In every marriage more than a week old there are grounds for divorce. The trick is to find and continue to find grounds for marriage.
Robert Anderson
A divorce is like an amputation: You survive it, but there's less of you.
Margaret Atwood
I've gone through a really hard divorce, and anyone who has gone through a divorce will speak about how hard the journey is from start to finish. It's a life-uprooting time.
Christina Aguilera
When two people decide to get a divorce, it isn't a sign that they don't understand one another, but a sign that they have, at last, begun to.
Helen Rowland
People do not get married planning to divorce. Divorce is the result of a lack of preparation for marriage and the failure to learn the skills of working together as teammates in an intimate relationship.
Gary Chapman
There would be fewer divorces if men gave as much loving attention to their wives as they do their cars and jobs.
Vikrant Parsai
Divorce is a fire exit. When a house is burning, it doesn't matter who set the fire.
Mehmet Murat ildan
Being divorced is like being hit by a Mack truck. If you live through it, you start looking very carefully to the right and to the left.
Jean Kerr
Every divorce is the result of selfishness on the part of one or the other or both parties to a marriage contract. Someone is thinking of self comforts, conveniences, freedoms, luxuries, or ease. Sometimes the ceaseless pin pricking of an unhappy, discontented, and selfish spouse can finally add up to serious physical violence. Sometimes people are goaded to the point where they erringly feel justified in doing the things that are so wrong. Nothing of course justifies sin.
Spencer W. Kimball
Getting divorced just because you don't love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do.
Zsa Zsa Gabor
The remedy for most marital stress is not in divorce. It is in repentance and forgiveness, in sincere expressions of charity and service. It is not in separation. It is in simple integrity that leads a man and a woman to square up their shoulders and meet their obligations. It is found in the Golden Rule, a time-honored principle that should first and foremost find expression in marriage.
Gordon B. Hinckle
Divorce is a failed challenge, which leads to a broken life. It is a socially transmittable disease that can transfer from one generation to another, and it is spreading fast.
Sia F. Dean
People get divorced for one reason and one reason only: One or both of them get selfish.
Pastor Mark Gungor
Each divorce is the death of a small civilization.
Pat Conroy
To get divorced because love has died, is like selling your car because it's run out of gas.
Diane Sollee
Divorce is like an amputation. Sometimes it's necessary but it should be avoided if at all possible because it brings about a permanent disability.
Bill Doherty
It takes two to destroy a marriage.
Margaret Trudeau
Divorce is one of the most financially traumatic things you can go through. Money spent on getting mad or getting even is money wasted.

Gerald F. Lieberman
For some reason, we see divorce as a signal of failure, despite the fact that each of us has a right, and an obligation, to rectify any other mistake we make in life.
Joyce Brothers
Divorce should be the last possible option, rather than something we should be smoothing the passage to.

Shinichi Suzuki
Divorce is a game played by lawyers.
Cary Grant
If you have been divorced, you know it hurts - especially if your marriage had lasted many years. Whatever the circumstances of your relationship, and whatever the nature of its ending, there is always grief and regret - perhaps regret over the ending, or perhaps regret over not ending the relationship sooner - or perhaps both. Nonetheless, move past the grief and regret. No matter how painful, divorce, like all endings, opens the door to new beginnings.
Jonathan Lockwood Huie
When people divorce, it's always such a tragedy. At the same time, if people stay together it can be even worse.

Evan Esar
So many persons think divorce a panacea for every ill, who find out, when they try it, that the remedy is worse than the disease.
DOROTHY DIX
Going through a divorce is like having every aspect of your life played back. Anything you have mishandled or regretted is talked about by everyone as they try to figure out who was right and who the innocent party really is. The comfort you once experienced is gone completely. There are many choices for new comfort, but most of them have no value except introducing new addictions or pounds of fat or guilt.
Kandace Cooper
Divorce isn't the child's fault. Don't say anything unkind about your ex to the child, because you're really just hurting the child.
Valerie Bertinelli
Marriages come and go, but divorces are forever.
Nora Ephron
Divorce is the price people play for playing with matches.
Evan Esar
Divorce can sometimes be for the better. You may end up with happier parents, and you will definitely learn a lot about yourself! And that's the whole point of growing up. So if you think about it, there are reasons to be happy about this experience, if you can learn and grow from it.
Zoe Stern
People that go through what I went through and people going through divorce, it's really a difficulty process; it's heartbreaking and it hurts really bad. It can really mess with your head.
David Arquette
Divorce: a resumption of diplomatic relations and rectification of boundaries.
Ambrose Bierce
Losing a mate to death is devastating but it's not a personal attack like divorce. When somebody you love stops loving you and walks away, it's an insult beyond comparison.
Sue Merrell
I don't see divorce as a failure. I see it as the end to a story. In a story, everything has an end and a beginning.
Olga Kurylenko
I used to think that divorce meant failure, but now I see it more as a step along the path of self-realization and growth
Alana Stewart
Divorce = Rebirth: forget the past, replan your life, improve your appearance & REJUVENATE!
Rossana Condoleo
Divorce in a young-adult novel means what being orphaned meant in a fairy tale: vulnerability, danger, unwanted independence.
Caitlin Flanagan
Divorce is open-heart surgery, emotionally. Some people are not willing to give it enough time, and their expectations for recovery are too fast. When you get up and go faster than you're supposed to and you push your healing cycle too quickly, you have to do it over again and you get a relapse.
Steve Grissom and Kathy Leonard

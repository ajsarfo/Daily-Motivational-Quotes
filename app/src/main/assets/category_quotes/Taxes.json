Taxes on consumption, like those on capital or income, to be just, must be uniform.
Benjamin Franklin
Taxes, well laid and well spent, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, and promote the general welfare. Taxes protect property and the environment; taxes make business possible. Taxes pay for roads and schools and bridges and police and teachers. Taxes pay for doctors and nursing homes and medicine.
Jill Lepore
Taxes are like and unlike the rain, they fall upon the just and the unjust; most hardly upon the just because they will not resort to devious ways to escape the imposition.
Paul Carus
Collecting more taxes than is absolutely necessary is legalized robbery.
Calvin Coolidge
Taxes on capital, taxes on labor, inflation, bureaucratic regulation, minimum wage laws, are all - to different degrees - unnecessary slices of the wedge that stand between an individual's effort and reward for that effort.
Jack Kemp
The payment of taxes gives a right to protection.
James M. Wayne
Taxes are nothing but a game of pick pocket.
Joseph Bonkowski
Taxes are way too complicated, and people spend way too much time worrying about ways to get them lower.
Steve Mnuchin
Taxes grow without rain.
Jewish Proverb
Taxes are like hot potatoes that get passed around. The poor man who does not pay for water at home may pay for it when he buys coffee downtown, where tax-paying businesses pass the cost on to consumers.
K. Filip Palda
Like mothers, taxes are often misunderstood, but seldom forgotten.
Lord Bramwell
Taxes are collected by governments in order to finance their expenditures and also for purposes of stabilization, distribution and allocation. Particular taxes may cause changes in people's behaviour and have an impact on aggregate demand that, therefore, influences the level of economic activity. Taxes are the instruments through which governments redistribute income and wealth and, moreover, they are an integral part of a government's fiscal policy as they are used to stabilize aggregate demand.
Nikolaos Karagiannis
Taxes are paid in the sweat of every man who labors.
Franklin D. Roosevelt
Taxes are the lifeblood of government and no taxpayer should be permitted to escape the payment of his just share of the burden of contributing thereto.
Arthur Vanderbilt
Tax reform is taking the taxes off things that have been taxed in the past and putting taxes on things that haven't been taxed before.
Art Buchwald
Taxes are never popular.
Luis Videgaray Caso
Taxes are just too high - that's obviously a priority.
Scott Garrett
Taxes are simply contributions demanded of citizens as their share of the expenses of government.
Paul Leroy
Taxes are not levied for the benefit of the taxed.
Robert A. Heinlein
Taxes are how we pool our money for public health and safety, infrastructure, research, and services--from the development of vaccines and the Internet to public schools and universities, transportation, courts, police, parks, and safe drinking water.
Holly Sklar
Taxes are what we pay for civilized society, for modernity, and for prosperity. The wealthy pay more because they have benefitted more.
Jill Lepore
Taxes are like a double chain which by keeping the peasants in the commune where they were born, fixes them still to the soil; though they are no longer, by law, attached to their master, they are always, by law, attached to each other.
Joseph Wilbois
In theory, taxes should be like shopping. What I buy is government services. What I pay are my taxes.
P. J. O'Rourke
Taxation is the price which civilized communities pay for the opportunity of remaining civilized.
Albert Bushnell Hart
Taxes, after all, are dues that we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.
Franklin D. Roosevelt
The avoidance of taxes is the only intellectual pursuit that still carries any reward.
John Maynard Keynes
Taxes are like the wheat poured into the public hopper; rent, in whatever form, may be described as the flour that comes from the public mill. The privileged man, who is allowed to carry off the grist, eats his bread, as it were, at the taxpayer's expense.
Charles Bowdoin Fillebrown
Any tax is a discouragement and therefore a regulation so far as it goes.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
Tax is never a stand alone issue. Tax is what you collect from the prosperity of the people, so if businesses are not thriving and individuals have no income, there is nothing to call tax.
Taiwo Oyedele
Taxes are the chief business of a conqueror of the world.
George Bernard Shaw
The power of taxing people and their property is essential to the very existence of government.
James Madison

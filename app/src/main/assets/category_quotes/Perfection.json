Edwin C. Bliss
Even if it's not perfect, set it aside and move on to the next thing. The idea of 'perfection' exists only in your mind, and may not be the same for everyone.
Haemin Sunim
One of our deepest fears is that when we show ourselves as we are, we will be rejected. We find it hard to open the door of our heart even to our closest friends. Because we carry that burden alone, it can't help but weigh us down. When someone opens the door to their heart and shows themselves as they are, do not judge them; warmly accept them. None of us is perfect.
Haemin Sunim
Perfection does not exist. To understand it is the triumph of human intelligence; the desire to possess it the most dangerous kind of madness.

Whether it is for riches or thinness, fitness or knowledge or fame, the desire for perfection shuts out all other people and pleasures one by one. It is an addiction like cocaine: even more deadly in proportion to its purity.

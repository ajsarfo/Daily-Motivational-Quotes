James Schmidt
Enlightenment has been implicated in one way or another in European imperialism and the most aggressive aspects of capitalism. While some have insisted that its skepticism about absolute values infects our culture with a nihilistic sluggishness, others have suggested that liberal societies should divest themselves of the Enlightenment's obsession with philosophical foundations.
James Schmidt
It is said that Enlightenment passion for rights and liberties unleashed a destructive individualism that undermines any sense of community. Yet it has also been argued that its assumption that human nature was infinitely malleable has provided the intellectual inspiration for attempts by totalitarian states to eradicate all traces of individuality from their subjects.

Enlightenment has been criticized for its insensitivity to the tragic character of moral conflicts and for its naive assumption that all dilemmas have simple solutions.

Enlightenment has been castigated for its affection for master metanarratives and its hostility toward otherness. Its racism and its sexism have not passed unnoticed.

Enlightenment is at all faithful to its subject. Reservations can be registered on at least two fronts. First, the images of the Enlightenment we have considered here are, at best, caricatures that highlight certain features but miss others. Second, what these caricatures miss may very well be what is of greatest importance in understanding the continuing viability of some version of hopes of the Enlightenment.
James Schmidt
The Enlightenment's significance was believed to transcent its immediate historical circumstances: it held out the prospect of a new, explicitly modern understanding of human beings' place in the world, and of radical improvement in the human condition.

Still, proponents of Enlightenment thought advanced the notion of one truth, one reason, and one morality. But often buried under its gloss of universal intellectualism was class and cultural bias that provided little space for otherness.

The enlightenment acquired a gravity of its own, which came at last to be one of its political conditions.

Enlightenment enthusiasms of the times, although shared with some, the desire to deflate certain aspects of its optimism.The interest in the place and scope of religion in society, in the nature of morality, but above all in our attempts to understand the workings of our own minds and our relation to the world we take ourselves to be a part of, are all part of mainstream philosophical thinking as well as themes of the enlightenment.
Peter Gilmour
Enlightenment thought was a cooperative result not due to any one person. It was to put chemistry in a relatively orderly state.

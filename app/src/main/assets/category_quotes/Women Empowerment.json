Susan B. Anthony
In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.
Sheryl Sandberg

Alessia Caracciolo, Andrew Wansel, Coleridge Tillman, Warren Felder
It is terrifying to people when women step up and start owning the story that they have not owned. And I’m seeing so much of this, and it is a seismic shift.
Amanda Palmer
There’s nothing more threatening than a powerful woman, and there’s nothing more threatening to the current order of things than women powerfully owning their own narrative. It’s so threatening to people, to women as well, and it’s threatening the order of things.
Amanda Palmer
I just love bossy women. I could be around them all day. To me, bossy is not a pejorative term at all. It means somebody’s passionate and engaged and ambitious and doesn’t mind learning.
Amy Poehler
I am a woman with thoughts and questions and shit to say. I say if I’m beautiful. I say if I’m strong. You will not determine my story⁠—I will.

A revolutionary woman can't have no reactionary man.
Assata Shakur

Atticus
I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own.
Audre Lorde
I write for those women who do not speak, for those who do not have a voice because they were so terrified, because we are taught to respect fear more than ourselves. We've been taught that silence would save us, but it won't.

Coretta Scott King
I changed what I could, and what I couldn't, I endured.

Madeleine Albright
I'm tough, ambitious, and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, okay.
Madonna
I raise up my voice—not so that I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard. … We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back.
Malala Yousafzai
Woman has always been the chief sufferer under this merciless machinery of the statutory law. Humbly she has borne the weight of man-made laws, surrendering to their tyranny even her right over her own body.... Against the State, against the Church, against the silence of the medical profession, against the whole machinery of dead institutions of the past, the woman of to‑day arises.... If she must break the law to establish her right to voluntary motherhood, then the law shall be broken.
Margaret Sanger

Meryl Streep
A strong woman understands that the gifts such as logic, decisiveness, and strength are just as feminine as intuition and emotional connection. She values and uses all of her gifts.
Nancy Rathburn
Fill your life with women that empower you, that help you believe in your magic and aid them to believe in their own exceptional power and their incredible magic too. Women that believe in each other can survive anything. Women who believe in each other create armies that will win kingdoms and wars.
Nikita Gill
It is not in the shallow physical imitation of men that women will assert first their equality and later their superiority, but in the awakening of the intellect of women.

One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.
Simone De Beauvoir
If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again!
Sojourner Truth
Sometimes when women get elected to positions of power they start acting like men. They start being tough like men. My vision and understanding of the world is a woman’s understanding of the world, not a man’s—I have never tried to copy a man. I think it’s very important that a woman remembers that she is a woman and not a man. You’re a woman, so keep being a woman and show women and men that you are a woman. This sends the very important message that women are equal to men.

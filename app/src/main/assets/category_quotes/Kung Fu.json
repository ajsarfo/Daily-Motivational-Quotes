A kung fu man lives without being dependant on the opinions of others, and a master, unlike the beginner, holds himself in reserve. He is quiet and unassuming, with no desire to show off.
Bruce Lee
Learning Kung fu has only one purpose: To train one's reaction into a natural response. Such reaction is essential.
Master Yuan Xiu Gang
The Chinese words ‘kung fu’ translate more or less as ‘a man hard at work over a long time’. If you want to unlock the full power of kung fu, it is not going to be easy: you are going to have to work, you are going to have to sacrifice and you are going to have to suffer – over a long time. There really is no such thing as a free lunch.
Master Iain Armstrong

Tai Chi Chuan, the great ultimate, strengthens the weak, raises the sick, invigorates the debilitated, and encourages the timid.

Wing Chun does not focus on fighting techniques, instead relaying on fighting and energy principles to be followed at all time.

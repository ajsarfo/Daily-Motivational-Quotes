Bhagavad Gita
Through the practices of yoga, we discover that concern for the happiness and well being of others, including animals, must be an essential part of our own quest for happiness and well being. The fork can be a powerful weapon of mass destruction or a tool to create peace on Earth.

When you inhale, you are taking the strength from God. When you exhale, it represents the service you are giving to the world.
B.K.S. Iyengar
Inhale, and God approaches you. Hold the inhalation, and God remains with you. Exhale, and you approach God. Hold the exhalation, and surrender to God.
Tirumalai Krishnamacharya
Enlightenment comes when you understand the language of heart - the language of tree, birds and the nature.

Ann Marie Frohoff
One of the fundamental principles of yoga: a small action done repeatedly can make an enormous difference.
Dr. Timothy McCall
True yoga is not about the shape of your body, but the shape of your life. Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived. Yoga doesn’t care about what you have been; yoga cares about the person you are becoming. Yoga is designed for a vast and profound purpose, and for it to be truly called yoga, its essence must be embodied.
Aadil Palkhivala
Yoga is the ultimate practice. It simultaneously stimulates our inner light and quiets our overactive minds. It is both energy and rest. Yin and Yang. We feel the burn and find our bliss.
Elise Joan
Balancing in yoga and life is a reflection of our inner state.
Shiva Rea
Yoga is about clearing away whatever is in us that prevents our living in the most full and whole way. With yoga, we become aware of how and where we are restricted — in body, mind, and heart — and how gradually to open and release these blockages. As these blockages are cleared, our energy is freed. We start to feel more harmonious, more at one with ourselves. Our lives begin to flow — or we begin to flow more in our lives.
Cybele Tomlinson
Yoga is a dance between control and surrender — between pushing and letting go — and when to push and when to let go becomes part of the creative process, part of the open-ended exploration of your being.
Joel Kramer
The goal of yoga is liberation from all limitations. So how do we overcome limitations? Look what happens when you do Hatha Yoga: a stiff and inflexible body will stretch, release and relax. In the same way, if you use the other tools of yoga you will stretch your mind and bring your essential self into the Light.
Swami Radhananda
People enjoy the practice of yoga in many different ways. Most do it because it is low impact form of exercise that quietens the mind. Some do it exclusively for the heightened awareness and presence that they get out of their yoga session.
Shanti Priva
The Yoga we practice is not for ourselves alone, but for the Divine; its aim is to work out the will of the Divine in the world, to effect a spiritual transformation and to bring down a divine nature and a divine into the mental, vital, and physical nature and life of humanity.
Sri Aurobindo
Hatha yoga is a refuge for all those who are scorched by the three fires. To those who practice yoga, hatha yoga is like the tortoise who supports the three worlds.
Hatha Yoga Pradipika

Guy Donahaye and Eddie Stern

Mary Glover
Yoga is invigoration in relaxation. Freedom in routine. Confidence through self control. Energy within and energy without.
Ymber Delecto
Practicing yoga during the day is a matter of keeping your eyes on the road and one ear turned toward the infinite. It's about listening inwardly as often as you can for your deepest impulses about what to say, think, do, or be.
Erich Schiffmann
Yoga, an ancient but perfect science, deals with the evolution of humanity. This evolution includes all aspects of one's being, from bodily health to self-realization. Yoga means union—the union of body with consciousness and consciousness with the soul.
B. K. S. Iyengar
Yoga does not remove us from the reality or responsibilities of everyday life but rather places our feet firmly and resolutely in the practical ground of experience. We don't transcend our lives; we return to the life we left behind in the hopes of something better.
Donna Farhi
The attitude of gratitude is the highest yoga.
Yogi Bhajan
The 'yoga' intuition is founded on the notion of transforming the body, & I don't know if there's any Christian alternative answer to it. Our present body is almost wholly unknown to the consciousness which inhabits it. Yoga creates an imaginative body in its place, & goes to work on that.
Northrop Frye
Yoga is the voluntary suppression of the involuntary actions of the mind. We're all born with a natural yoga: we're freed by objective energy and our consciousness freezes it into matter.
Northrop Frye
I was frequently so wrought up that I had to do certain yoga exercises in order to hold my emotions in check. But since it was my purpose to know what was going on within myself, I would do these exercises only until I had calmed myself enough to resume my work with the unconscious. As soon as I had the feeling that I was myself again, I abandoned this restraint upon the emotions and allowed the images and inner voices to speak afresh. The Indian, on the other hand, does yoga exercises in order to obliterate completely the multitude of psychic contents and images.
Carl Jung
They call it 'European Yoga.' Well people are doing it all over Europe. I mean, standing up, doing yoga day and night. They hardly ever stop. I mean, some countries have given up chairs completely.

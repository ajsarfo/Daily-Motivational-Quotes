There is no real wealth but the labor of man.
Percy Bysshe Shelley
Labor is man's greatest function. He is nothing, he can do nothing, he can achieve nothing, he can fulfill nothing, without working.
Orville Dewey
Labor is still, and ever will be, the inevitable price set upon everything which is valuable.
Samuel Smiles
For as labor cannot produce without the use of land, the denial of the equal right to the use of land is necessarily the denial of the labor to its own produce.
Henry George
Labor can not stand still. It must not retreat. It must go on, or go under.
Harry Bridges
It is labor alone that is productive: it creates wealth and therewith lays the outward foundations for the inward flowering of man.
Ludwig Von Mises
Labor rids us of three great evils poverty, vice, and boredom.
Voltaire
Labor wants pride and joy in doing good work, a sense of making or doing something beautiful or useful to be treated with dignity and respect as brother and sister.

A man is not idle because he is absorbed in thought. There is a visible labor and there is an invisible labor.

Ferdinand Lassalle
It is only through labor and painful effort, by grim energy and resolute courage, that we move on to better things.
Theodore Roosevelt
All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence.
Martin Luther King, Jr.
Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.
Abraham Lincoln

George Meany
Before the reward there must be labor. You plant before you harvest. You sow in tears before you reap joy.

As labor creates the wealth of the country, we demand the passage of such laws as may be necessary to protect it in all its rights.
John Peter Altgeld
Labor is the fruit of civilization, not the basis of it.
Alexander Crummell
Labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutalized.
Nathaniel Hawthorne
It is only by labor that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labor can be happy; and the two cannot be separated with impunity.

Labor is today the most vital and potential power this planet has ever known, and its historic mission is as certain of ultimate realization as is the setting of the sun.
Eugene V. Debs
Labor gives birth to ideas.
Jim Rohn
Labor is the fabled magician's wand, the philosophers stone, and the cap of good fortune.

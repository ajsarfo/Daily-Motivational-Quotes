An injury is much sooner forgotten than an insult.
Lord Chesterfield
If a man's character is to be abused, say what you will, there's nobody like a relation to do the business.
William Makepeace Thackeray
Use, do not abuse; neither abstinence nor excess ever renders man happy.
Voltaire
The greater the power, the more dangerous the abuse.
Edmund Burke
Let us not forget who we are. Drug abuse is a repudiation of everything America is.
Ronald Reagan
The million little things that drop into your hands, The small opportunities each day brings, He leaves us free to use or abuse, And goes unchanging along His silent way.
Helen Keller
Adversity has the effect of eliciting talents, which in prosperous circumstances would have lain dormant.
Horace
Liberty may be endangered by the abuse of liberty, but also by the abuse of power.
James Madison

Harriet Elizabeth Beecher Stowe
Abuse of words has been the great instrument of sophistry and chicanery, of party, faction, and division of society.
John Adams
If the cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now surely fail. . . . Because the goal of America is freedom, abused and scorned tho' we may be, our destiny is tied up with America's destiny.
Martin Luther King
Books are the best of things, well used; abused, among the worst. What is the right use? What is the one end, which all means go to effect? They are for nothing but to inspire.
Ralph Waldo Emerson

P.G. Wodehouse
Family!... the home of all social evil, a charitable institution for comfortable women, an anchorage for house-fathers, and a hell for children.
August Strindberg
As a rule, you see, I’m not lugged into Family Rows. On the occasions when Aunt is calling to Aunt like mastodons bellowing across primeval swamps and Uncle James’s letter about Cousin Mabel’s peculiar behaviour is being shot round the family circle...the clan has a tendency to ignore me.
P. G. Wodehouse
After a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.

Walter Peralta
Family reunions can be brutal. Our last one, we lost two cousins and a sheep dog.
Monroe
Honey, driving across town to a family reunion, cooking, cleaning, organizing and budgeting is not fun and *not* a vacation! Yet, it's what I do with my free time.
Beth Newton
Family reunions are about uniting the family, bringing together the young and old. Singing and dancing and thanking God, giving him the glory. Thanking him for getting us over.

Heidi Swapp
When our hearts turn to our ancestors, something changes inside us. We feel part of something greater than ourselves. Our inborn yearnings for family connections are fulfilled when we are linked to our ancestors.
Russell M. Nelson
No matter how you feel about your extended family or family gatherings you will be attending. This is because now the ultimate reason for attending family gatherings is for your children to have the time of their lives with their cousins. Little kids love their cousins. I’m not being cute or exaggerating here. Cousins are like celebrities for little kids. If little kids had a People magazine, cousins would be on the cover. Cousins are the barometers of how fun a family get-together will be.

Memorizing, guessing, looking at pictures, predicting, substituting, and skipping, are not reading; they are very bad habits.
Phyllis Schlafly
To cure worry, spend fifteen minutes daily filling your mind full of God. Worry is just a very bad mental habit. You can change any habit with God's help.
Norman Vincent Peale
Habits begin to form at the very first repetition. After that there is a tropism toward repetition, for the patterns involved are defenses , bulwarks against time and despair.
Kim Stanley
These various habits of thought, or habitual expressions of life, are all phases of the single life sequence of the individual; therefore a habit formed in response to a given stimulus will necessarily affect the character of the response made to other stimuli. A modification of human nature at any one point is a modification of human nature as a whole.
Thorstein Veblen
An unfortunate thing about this world is that the good habits are much easier to give up than the bad ones.
W. Somerset Maugham
Habits begin as offhanded remarks, ideas and images. And then, layer upon layer, through practice, they grow from cobwebs into cables that shackle or strengthen our lives.
Denis Waitley
Habit must play a larger place in our religious life. We worship when we feel like it, we pray when we feel like it. We read the Bible when we feel like it. Leaving our religious exercises to the promptings of impulse, we become creatures of impulse rather than soldiers of Christ. An army made up of creatures of impulse would be only a mob. So is a church.
Ralph Washington Sockman
Life becomes a habit. You get up, dress, eat, go tae work, clock in etcetera etcetera automatically, and think about nothing but the pay packet on Friday and the booze-up last Saturday. Life's easy when you're a robot.
Alasdair Gray
Habit is the most imperious of all masters.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
Good habits are hard to develop but easy to live with; bad habits are easy to develop but hard to live with. The habits you have and the habits that have you will determine almost everything you achieve or fail to achieve.
Brian Tracy
Repetition of the same thought or physical action develops into a habit which, repeated frequently enough, becomes an automatic reflex.

Be careful what you choose to do consciously, for unless your will is very strong, that is what you may have to do repeatedly and compulsively through the habit-influencing power of the subconscious mind.
Paramahansa Yogananda
The only habits you never conquer are the ones you put off doing something about.
Wess Roberts
Habit is a man's sole comfort. We dislike doing without even unpleasant things to which we have become accustomed.

Habit is a second nature which prevents us from knowing the first, of which it has neither the cruelties nor the enchantments.
Marcel Proust
Your behavior is based on your beliefs, and what you do and say, over and over again, helps develop your habits.
Darren Johnson
Habit is thus the enormous flywheel of society, its most precious conservative agent. It alone is what keeps us all within the bounds of ordinance, and saves the children of fortune from the envious uprisings of the poor.
William James
Habit gives endurance, and fatigue is the best night cap.
Jamaica Kincaid
Habit is the beneficent harness of routine which enables silly men to live respectfully and unhappy men to live calmly.

The wise say that our failure is to form habits: for habit is the mark of a stereotyped world.

Habits are like the wrinkles on a man's brow; if you will smooth out the one, I will smooth out the other.
Josh Billings
Success is not a sometimes thing. In other words, you don't do what is right once in awhile, but all the time. Success is a habit. Winning is a habit.
Vince Lombardi
Practice hope. As hopefulness becomes a habit, you can achieve a permanently happy spirit.
Norman Vincent Peale
Basically, morphic fields are fields of habit, and they've been set up through habits of thought, through habits of activity, and through habits of speech. Most of our culture is habitual.
Rupert Sheldrake
Successful people form habits that feed their success, instead of habits that feed their failure.
Jeff Olson

Clement Greenberg
Habit is the cement of society, the comfort of life, and, alas! The root of error.
Fulke Greville

Elbert Hubbard
Habits are where our lives and careers and bodies are made.
Seth Godin
Habits, soft and pliant at first, are like some coral stones, which are easily cut when first quarried, but soon become hard as adamant.
Charles Spurgeon
Creativity is a habit, and the best creativity is a result of good work habits.
Twyla Tharp
Good habits are the key to all success. Bad habits are the unlocked door to failure.
Og Mandino
To make anything a habit, do it; to not make it a habit, do not do it; to unmake a habit, do something else in place of it.
Epictetus
Habit and routine have an unbelievable power to waste and destroy.
Henri de Lubac
I believe you can never change a habit, or create one, with a word or a piece of chalk. You can talk all day, put all sorts of diagrams on the board, but a habit is not going to change. It's a conditional reflex, created by a repetitive act.
Pete Newell
Do something everyday that you don't want to do; this is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty without pain.

You are what you do repeatedly every day. If excellence is something you're striving for, then it's not an accident. It's a habit.
Greg Plitt
Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.
Jim Ryun
The habit of virtue cannot be formed in a closet. Habits are formed by acts of reason in a persevering struggle through temptation.

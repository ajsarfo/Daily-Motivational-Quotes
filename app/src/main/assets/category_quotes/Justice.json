Social justice cannot be attained by violence. Violence kills what it intends to create.
Pope John Paul II
Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.
Benjamin Franklin
We are not to simply bandage the wounds of victims beneath the wheels of injustice, we are to drive a spoke into the wheel itself.
Dietrich Bonhoeffer
If one really wishes to know how justice is administered in a country, one does not question the policemen, the lawyers, the judges, or the protected members of the middle class. One goes to the unprotected--those, precisely, who need the law's protection most!--and listens to their testimony.
James Baldwin
Men often mistake killing and revenge for justice. They seldom have the stomach for justice.

Justice is conscience, not a personal conscience but the conscience of the whole of humanity.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn
Equal justice under law is not merely a caption on the facade of the Supreme Court building, it is perhaps the most inspiring ideal of our society. It is one of the ends for which our entire legal system exists...it is fundamental that justice should be the same, in substance and availability, without regard to economic status.
Lewis Powell, Jr.
If we do not maintain justice, justice will not maintain us.
Francis Bacon
The failure to invest in civil justice is directly related to the increase in criminal disorder. The more people feel there is injustice the more it becomes part of their psyche.
Wilhelm Joseph
Throughout history, it has been the inaction of those who could have acted, the indifference of those who should have known better, the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most, that has made it possible for evil to triumph.
Haile Selassie
Justice is the means by which established injustices are sanctioned.
Anatole France
This thing that men call justice, this blind snake that strikes men down in the dark, mindless with fury, keep your hand back from it, pass by in silence.
Maxwell Anderson
The just man is not the product of a day, but of a long brooding and a painful birth. To become a power for peace, a man must first pass through experiences which lead him to see things in their different aspects: it is necessary that he have a wide horizon, and breathe various atmospheres--in a word, from crossing, one after another, paths and points of view the most diverse, and sometimes the most contradictory, he must acquire the faculty of putting himself in the place of others and appreciating them.
Charles Wagner
The need for justice grows out of the conflict of human interests. That is to say, if there were no conflict of interests among mankind we should never have invented the word justice, nor conceived the idea for which it stands.
Thomas Nixon Carver
Justice is always violent to the party offending, for every man is innocent in his own eyes.
Daniel Defoe
Justice is the tolerable accommodation of the conflicting interests of society, and I don't believe there is any royal road to attain such accommodation concretely.
Judge Learned Hand
The whole history of the world is summed up in the fact that, when nations are strong, they are not always just, and when they wish to be just, they are no longer strong.
Winston Churchill
Injustice is relatively easy to bear; it is justice that hurts.
H.L. Mencken
Justice should remove the bandage from her eyes long enough to distinguish between the vicious and the unfortunate.

Plato
Peace is not the absence of war but the presence of justice.
Harrison Ford
Where there are too many policemen, there is no liberty. Where there are too many soldiers, there is no peace. Where there are too many lawyers, there is no justice.
Lyn Yutang
The administration of justice is the firmest pillar of government
George Washington
Law in origin was merely a codification of the power of dominant groups, and did not aim at anything that to a modern man would appear to be justice

unknown
The end doesn't justify the means.
Ovid
Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends.
J.R.R. Tolkien
Ladies who play with fire must remember that smoke gets in their eyes.
Mae West
Truth never damages a cause that is just.
Mahatma Gandhi
It is better to risk saving a guilty person than to condemn an innocent one.
Voltaire
The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.
Theodore Parker
For there is but one essential justice which cements society, and one law which establishes this justice. This law is right reason, which is the true rule of all commandments and prohibitions. Whoever neglects this law, whether written or unwritten, is necessarily unjust and wicked.
Marcus Tullius Cicero
Never forget that justice is what love looks like in public.
Cornel West
I have always found that mercy bears richer fruits than strict justice
Abraham Lincoln
Each of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done.

Halls of justice painted green . Money talking . Power wolves beset your door .

Truth Justice loves, and truth injustice fears, . Truth above all things a just man reveres.
John Denham
When justice on offenders is not done, . Law, government, and commerce, are o'erthrown.
John Denham
Justice with weight and measure must proceed . Yet when pronouncing sentence, seem not glad . Such spectacles, though they are just, are sad.
John Denham
Justice, when equal scales she holds, is blind . Nor cruelty, nor mercy, change her mind.
John Denham
WHAT do the scales of Justice hold . Poised even in that steady hand? . What is that measure closely scanned? . Is one side weighted down with gold? .
Bessie Rayner Parkes
With level brows this Justice stands . And weighs her duties one by one . And if she pleads, or if commands . It is lest these be left undone.
Bessie Rayner Parkes
Or slurred through weakness and constraint . This noble Justice was not bred . In hearts defiled with any taint . Of selfish seeking, dark and dead.
Bessie Rayner Parkes

TWO lawyers to their cause so well adhered . A country justice quite confused appeared . By them the facts were rendered so obscure . With which the truth remained he was not sure.
La Fontaine
When you've been denied justice... you are incomplete. It feels that God has abandoned you in a stark place. I asked God... I think we all did... what we should do, and he said do what is right. And I thought if I did, it would make me complete again.
